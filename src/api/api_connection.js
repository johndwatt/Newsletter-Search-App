OUR proudly presented the 2021 Outstanding Faculty Mentor Award to Dr. Barchard for her record of excellence in inspiring, influencing, supporting, and mentoring undergraduate researchers in their professional development, career training, and educational journey.</span></p>\n<hr><!-- –– ######################### ––--><p></p>\n<p style=\"line-height: 1.6;\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\"><b>Describe your current role and research interests.&nbsp;</b><br>I am a Professor in the Department of Psychology. &nbsp;Over the years, I have studied a wide variety of topics, from theoretical statistics to practical decision-making. &nbsp;Recently, I have turned my research to the climate crisis.</span></p>\n<p><!-- –– ######################### ––--></p>\n<p style=\"line-height: 1.6;\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\">Most people in the US are concerned about climate change. &nbsp;But some people view climate change as affecting other people in far off locations rather than having immediate local impacts, and some people recognize climate change is affecting the places they love, right now, but do not know what they can do about this global problem. &nbsp;Therefore, I have started research to determine how we can help people recognize the immediate local impacts of climate change to create a sense of immediacy and urgency, how we can increase people’s sense of self-efficacy so they act on their beliefs, and how we can encourage people to act sustainably by harnessing the power of social norms.</span></p>\n<p style=\"line-height: 1.6;\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\"><b>What inspired you to start conducting research and what motivates you to pursue research in your field?</b><br>Enthusiasm about research is contagious. &nbsp;One day during my Personality Psychology course, the instructor gave a lecture about his own research. &nbsp;He was so animated and enthusiastic that I went to his office hours to ask how I could get involved. &nbsp;This led me to complete an honors thesis, go to graduate school, and pursue a research career.</span></p>\n<p style=\"line-height: 1.6;\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\">Throughout my career, I have followed my interests, reading about topics that intrigue me and then designing new research on unanswered questions. &nbsp;I like learning new things and figuring out how they fit together – fiddling with the phrasing and formatting of questionnaires, writing complex programs to analyze my data, and drawing graphs to discern how variables affect each other. &nbsp;I am grateful I received course credit to do research when I was a student, which now allows me to be paid to do what I love: conduct research and teach others how to do so.</span></p>\n<p style=\"line-height: 1.6;\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\"><b>How do you define undergraduate research and why do you recommend getting involved in research?</b><br>Many undergraduates design and conduct experiments as part of a research methods course. &nbsp;Research experience builds upon that foundation by providing individual mentoring on a longer project. &nbsp;Students can work with faculty and graduate students by volunteering in a research lab, registering for independent study or independent research, or participating in the Center for Academic Enrichment and Outreach spring semester research experience or summer research institute.</span></p>\n<p style=\"line-height: 1.6;\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\">Research experience is the best way for students to earn strong letters of recommendation for graduate school, law school, and medical school. &nbsp;Even if students are not planning to go to a post-baccalaureate program, research experience will challenge students in ways that are not available in the typical undergraduate classroom, allowing them to develop their problem-solving, communication, and team-work skills – skills that are in high demand in the workplace. &nbsp;Therefore, I recommend individually mentored research experience to any undergraduate who wants to get more out of their undergraduate years.</span></p>\n<p style=\"line-height: 1.6;\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\"><b>What advice would you give to undergraduates looking to become involved in research?</b><br><em><b>Start early</b></em><br>Many graduate programs want students to have at least a year of research experience when they apply. &nbsp;Even if students are not applying to a post-baccalaureate program, once they have started doing research, they usually want to do more. &nbsp;Thus, it’s good to start in your junior year. &nbsp;That said, it’s never too late to start. &nbsp;Students sometimes join a research lab just before graduation (or even after graduation), when they realize they need research experience to pursue their academic plans. &nbsp;Therefore, if you wish you had gotten started earlier, don’t despair: Just get started now.</span></p>\n<p style=\"line-height: 1.6;\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\"><em><b>Do lots</b></em><br>The more you put into your research, the more you will get out of it. I recommend students spend at least 10 hours per week. &nbsp;If you don’t have that much time right now, start smaller. &nbsp;If you decide you want more experience, figure out how to fit it into your schedule next semester. &nbsp;For example, maybe you can register for an independent study course that will count towards your degree or maybe you can join one of the UNLV programs that provide student stipends.</span></p>\n<p style=\"line-height: 1.6;\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\"><em><b>Follow your interests</b></em><br>Talk to the instructor or teaching assistant in your favorite course to learn how you can get involved in that kind of research. &nbsp;Alternatively, use the department website to learn about ongoing projects at UNLV.</span></p>\n<p style=\"line-height: 1.6;\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\"><b>What is the process for students interested in conducting research under your mentorship?</b><br>Students who are interested in joining our lab typically email me to introduce themselves. &nbsp;After we have talked by email, they meet with a couple of our current lab members to learn more about our research. Usually they start their research experience at the beginning of the next semester in a cohort of 2 to 8 new lab members. &nbsp;We do not set any maximum number of research assistants: We welcome everyone who is a good fit for our lab.</span></p>\n<p style=\"line-height: 1.6;\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\">New lab members learn essential research skills, such as how to design online studies and how to analyze data using SPSS and R. &nbsp;They also start planning what they’ll do after graduation by designing their curriculum vitae, drafting a statement of purpose, and looking into post-baccalaureate programs. &nbsp;After their first semester, lab members analyze data to create professional conference posters, learn advanced statistical techniques, and run workshops. &nbsp;Advanced lab members create new psychological measures and design and run new studies. &nbsp;Many lab members stay in my lab for six semesters or more, but they never run out of new things they can learn.</span></p>\n<p style=\"line-height: 1.6;\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\"><b>How has the Office of Undergraduate Research (OUR) supported your research endeavors?</b><br>Sharing your findings with others is an essential step in the research process. &nbsp;However, presenting at out-of-town conferences is time-consuming and expensive. &nbsp;Fortunately, OUR helps students communicate their findings to the academic community. &nbsp;Eleven of our lab members have presented their work at the OUR Undergraduate Research Symposia in the last two years, and two are currently preparing a manuscript to submit to the Spectra Undergraduate Research Journal.</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:100px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n",

Her mentor explained that she would need to get research experience and that she would need to perform well on the Graduate Record Exam, so she set out to work on these two goals. First, she joined the Interactive Measurement Group. Over the last five semesters, she has completed over 1,200 lab hours, during which she completed three posters (two of which have already been presented at professional conferences), served as the managing editor for the lab’s newsletter and, most recently, helped design a new research study. In Spring 2022, she also joined the Psychophysiology of Emotion and Personality lab, where she has learned how to run participants through electroencephalogram (EEG) and behavioral studies. Throughout this period, Cassandra has also been studying for the GRE and has significantly improved her practice test scores. This will serve her well when she takes the GRE this summer. Cassandra’s continued progress toward her OUMP goals has not only helped her prepare for graduate school, but it has also recently earned her the OUMP Shining Star Award.</p>\n<p>Congratulations, Cassandra!</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<hr size=\"15\" />\n",

Previous research has shown that mindfulness reduces job burnout. His thesis explored the hypothesis that positive reappraisal mediates that relationship. Using a sample of 325 MTurk workers, Fitsum showed that, for all five facets of mindfulness, positive reappraisal partially or fully mediates the mindfulness-burnout relationship. This suggests that people who are experiencing job burnout can use whichever mindfulness skills are most appealing to them: All of them have the potential to be helpful. Fitsum presented his honors research at the Spring 2022 Research Symposium sponsored by the Office of Undergraduate Research, where he received the Research and Creative Honors Thesis Presentation award for giving the best honors thesis presentation. Congratulations, Fitsum!</p>\n<p class=\"body\">\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<hr size=\"15\" />\n",

I made it through my first couple semesters with little difficulty and good grades to boot. But in my third semester, something shook my world. This is when I joined UNLV’s Outreach Undergraduate Mentoring Program (OUMP) and quickly learned that good grades weren’t going to get me into graduate school – I needed research experience. Moreover, since I had such a busy schedule, I needed to get a head start on studying for the GRE and investigating possible graduate schools. The thought of adding anything else to my plate was quite overwhelming, but I took the advice of my OUMP mentor and began using a calendar to manage my time. Now that I’m in my final semester, looking back at all that I’ve accomplished, I know that none of it would have been possible had I not made her – my calendar – my best friend. </p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">Our friendship has taught me two important lessons. The first of which is this: Schedule EVERYTHING! When I first started out, I scheduled the obvious. I apprised my calendar of exam dates and assignment due dates, and I worked with her to schedule blocks of study/reading time. After joining the Interactive Measurement Group, I kept her up to date on lab meetings, poster assignments, and other lab homework. Initially, it seemed to be working well, but I soon noticed that the things I omitted weren’t getting done. For example, I wasn’t scheduling time to study for the GRE or research graduate schools. Concerned I wasn’t doing all that is necessary to get into graduate school, I consulted my calendar. She helped me find available blocks of time where I could squeeze these things in, and I started to make visible progress on these additional goals. With her help, I have now significantly improved my GRE practice test scores and compiled a list of schools to apply to. I suppose it’s a lot like any relationship – communication is key. If I don’t communicate all of my goals to my calendar, she can’t help me accomplish them.</p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">The second lesson our friendship has taught me is that I must estimate how long each task will take. Moreover, I must reexamine my estimate if I find a task is taking longer than anticipated. For example, when I first began taking 300-level courses, I timed how long it took to read a typical chapter and then consulted my calendar so we could set aside reading time each week. This worked wonderfully – until I started taking 400-level courses. Halfway through a reading assignment, I heard my calendar yelling at me – reminding me it was time for our next task. Determined to finish my reading assignment before moving on, I ignored her and then had to rearrange the next several days to fit in the tasks that hadn’t gotten done. After a couple of these instances, and some nagging from my calendar, I agreed to reexamine the time allotted for these readings. Together, we looked at how long my most recent readings had taken, and we updated my schedule accordingly. Again, communicating with my calendar helped me succeed – and with a lot less stress. </p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">When my calendar and I first met, I believed she would be a great help to me. But I didn’t know just how much. Over time, I realized that maintaining a strong relationship with her was and always will be essential to my success. I highly recommend not just using a calendar, but truly making friends with it – relying on it to support you in ALL of your goals. Schedule EVERYTHING. Estimate how long it will take to complete each task and reexamine your estimates when they aren’t working for you. Doing this will help prevent backing yourself into a corner with too much on your plate and not enough time. By making my calendar my best friend, I was able to successfully maintain a full-time job, take classes, and participate in a research lab – all while preparing for graduate school and remaining on track to graduate summa cum laude. I encourage you to do the same and find out firsthand the success your calendar can help you achieve.  </p>\n\n\n<hr size=\"15\">\n<p class=\"bodytext\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http://img.faculty.unlv.edu/lab/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Author-Photo-2-Cassandra-September-20-2021-DONE-1.jpg\" alt=\"jd\" width=\"181\" height=\"195\" align=\"left\" hspace=\"5\" vspace=\"1\">Cassandra Hoffman has been a member of the Interactive Measurement Group since the fall of 2020. During her time in the lab, she has served as a poster team leader and managing editor for the lab’s newsletter, and she has conducted a variety of workshops to help new and existing lab members. She is graduating this semester with a B.A. in psychology and a minor in neuroscience. After graduation, she plans to pursue a Ph.D. in clinical psychology, hopefully doing research on moral injury and/or trauma-related disorders.</p>\n<br>\n<p class=\"bodytext\">&nbsp;</p>\n<hr size=\"15\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n",

But as the saying goes––there ain’t no such thing as a free lunch. Future Me paid for my procrastination by working overloaded: She felt stressed by all the deadlines and had to give up things she enjoyed. I paid for my procrastination because she threw negative emotions back at me: I felt anxious and ashamed. Moreover, I sometimes chose to deal with these negative feelings by immersing myself in instant gratification, ending up with more procrastination. I thought I would never be friends with Future Me because I was mean to her. Procrastination was always a barrier in our relationship. </p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">The two-minute rule helped cure my procrastination. In his book, Atomic Habits, James Clear says to do the task you need to do for two minutes, and if you still hate doing it after two minutes, stop. Before trying the two-minute rule, I thought it might make my procrastination worse, giving me an excuse to stop after just two minutes. However, it really worked for me! One day, my homework was to summarize several research papers. I didn’t feel like doing it because I thought it would be hard, so I naturally wanted to let Future Me take over that task because she would “have more time to work on it.” But then I remembered the two-minute rule and decided to try it. During those first two minutes, I found I actually enjoyed the topic and would like to spend more time on it. It turned out that I studied for two solid hours and got the assignment finished. My procrastination was cured! </p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">Now, whenever I feel like procrastinating, I force myself to try things for two minutes. Once I start working, I usually find the tasks to be easier and more enjoyable than I imagined. This has really motivated me to keep using the two-minute rule. Now I finish most tasks way ahead of the deadlines, allowing Future Me to do the things she wants. I also feel more powerful because I live a productive life and have fewer negative emotions. Not only did the two-minute rule cure my procrastination, it also helped me build a healthier relationship with Future Me. </p>\n\n<hr size=\"15\">\n<p class=\"bodytext\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http://img.faculty.unlv.edu/lab/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/unnamed-e1650491782887.jpg\" alt=\"jd\" width=\"175\" height=\"194\" align=\"left\" hspace=\"5\" vspace=\"1\">Yuhan Bi has been a member of the Interactive Measurement Group since the summer of 2021.

When writing this novel, Maxwell drew on his memories of losing his own mother during that pandemic. During our more recent pandemic, I read They Came Like Swallows as part of my thesis, reading and re-reading sections, placing post-it notes near important passages, and scribbling notes in the margins. Beyond my academic interests, I found camaraderie with Maxwell and Bunny; the focus on everyday, yet deeply personal and meaningful, moments struck a chord with me. Maxwell taught me to appreciate and find solace in mundane moments.</p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">I gained this insight from the nostalgic, albeit melancholic, scenes where Maxwell recollects the small, ordinary moments from his life before his mother’s death. For example, at one point, Bunny sits with his mother at a window seat in their Lincoln, Illinois home. Nothing particularly noteworthy takes place, but Bunny still narrates the small details – patterns on the rug, slight noises in the house, and locations of items and furniture. Readers leave this moment with a feeling of comfort and solace because Bunny feels at peace and safe in his house. As I analyzed Maxwell’s use of his art to communicate and relive the most comfortable and wholesome times of his life, I looked at the ordinary items around my own home in a new light: the cobalt blue couch I insisted on purchasing, the plants near the windows, the bookcase that takes up a whole wall, pictures of my and my partner’s families. I appreciated my quiet home filled with items connected to my happiness and peace. I realized that these ordinary pieces of furniture, familiar books, and pictures from my favorite memories bring joy to even the most mundane days.</p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">Despite finding happiness and peace inside my home, the glaring absence of my family felt heavy. Due to the pandemic and living in a different state for graduate school, I had not seen my family for almost two years. Maxwell’s narration reminded me of what I wanted most: time with my family. Just like Maxwell, I reflected on the small moments with my loved ones before the pandemic, and I longed for the minute details that always subconsciously comforted me. For instance, Maxwell’s window seat scene reminded me of spending Friday evenings with my family: After a stressful day, we shared work stories while eating takeout and listening to the local news. Maxwell’s text reminded me to appreciate those memories; while they may have been small, they were far from insignificant. Mundane experiences often carry the most comfort and solace due to their familiarity. </p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">With newfound respect and appreciation for ordinary occasions, I met with my family via Skype and Zoom more often, and we reintegrated our Friday-evening-hangouts into our schedules. Just like Maxwell and his mother, along with the fictional Bunny and his mother, my family and I rejoiced in the small victory of spending time with one another. I learned not to take ordinary experiences for granted – a valuable lesson during an arguably terrible time in history. Almost an entire year later, in 2021, I safely traveled back to Las Vegas to see my family in person. Just as we did before the pandemic and my move, we fell into a comfortable pattern of conversations in the cozy living room, exchanging work stories, and discussing nothing and everything. </p>\n\n\n<hr size=\"15\">\n<p class=\"bodytext\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http://img.faculty.unlv.edu/lab/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Barraza-Photo-DONE-e1650493367212.jpg\" alt=\"jd\" width=\"156\" height=\"195\" align=\"left\" hspace=\"5\" vspace=\"1\">Kristy Barraza was a member of the Interactive Measurement Group from Spring 2016 to Fall 2017.

Over the past five semesters, he has taken on a wide variety of challenging leadership and research roles.  As poster supervisor for the last year, Orei designed and taught lessons on confirmatory factor analysis and mentored eight teams as they created conference posters. Orei also helped design our first study on climate change, which included the creation of a new measure: the 77-item Climate Change Action Inventory.  In addition, Orei has chaired lab meetings, mentored junior lab members formally and informally, and given feedback on a variety of posters, presentations, papers, and even computer programs.  Orei graduated from UNLV with a B.A. in Psychology in December 2021. In Fall 2022, he will begin pursuing a Master’s degree in Clinical Mental Health Counseling at UNLV.

During this time, she obtained extensive research experience. When she first joined our lab, she completed workshops on basic computers skills that are essential to our research, including email, Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Photoshop, and SPSS. She quickly moved on to advanced skills, such as creating online simulations and studies, scoring an open-ended test by hand and with the computer, and advanced data analysis skills such as hierarchical multiple regression and the R statistical program. Aika used these skills to redesign our lab website, write an article for our lab newsletter, and create two conference posters. She also wrote a solo poster that she presented virtually at Hakuoh University.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">At the same time, Aika obtained extensive teaching and mentoring experience. She taught several hour-long workshops on how to analyze data in SPSS, create websites and online studies, and score open-ended tests by hand. Seeing how others were struggling before and during the pandemic, Aika created well-researched and well-received presentations on self-care and working remotely. She also mentored several lab members as they wrote newsletter articles, provided feedback on many lab members’ posters and presentations, and helped all lab members manage their workloads. Finally, Aika was the leader for one of her posters, guiding two new lab members in all stages of data analysis, writing, and presenting.</p>\n<p>All these experiences have paid off. Aika has now been accepted to her top choice, the Boyd School of Law. Congratulations, Aika!</p>\n<hr size=\"15\">\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n",

First, I learned how to be present in the moment. I was always the type of person who liked to keep a mental checklist of things I needed to do whenever I went somewhere. This changed on my first major trip with my new friends. Before heading to Rome, I compiled a list of attractions I wanted to see like the Coliseum, the Pantheon, the Trevi Fountain, etc. However, after we got to the Trevi Fountain, we ended up spending a good amount of time there rather than rushing off to the next attraction like I intended to do. This was due to the fact that it was a tradition to flip a coin into the fountain and make a wish; since it was a very popular thing to do, we had to wait our turn. Previously, I would have felt this was an inefficient use of my time: I would usually just want to take a photo or two and then move on. But being there with my friends and enjoying my time with them made me want to stay. After the Trevi Fountain, we ended up heading to this famous gelato shop and just started casually walking around the city without a goal in mind. We weren’t all that fussed about going to this place or that. We were just enjoying the moment and taking in all the finer details of the city. For example, we noticed the vastly different architecture of the various buildings and houses. It almost felt like we were looking at the past. That’s when I realized you can miss a lot of amazing moments in life when you are always rushing off to the next destination/goal. </p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">Second, I learned how to keep an open mind and not be stuck in one frame of thinking. On several occasions, I discovered that I couldn’t be biased or rigid or else I would not be able to do things I wanted to do. For example, some of my friends got sick and had to see a doctor. I went along to provide moral support. When we arrived at the doctor’s office, calling us shocked would be an understatement. My friends, instead of seeing a primary care physician, ended up seeing the resident gynecologist and obstetrician. At the time, I thought it was crazy to see an OBGYN for general illness, since they would be more accustomed to treating genitourinary problems than a cough or an ear infection and could run the risk of misdiagnosing a patient. However, for the most part the medications and diagnoses my friends got were in line with what they would have typically gotten if seen by a primary care physician. Later on, we learned that if you wanted to see a traditional primary care physician you would have to drive or take a train to Rome to find one. We then understood why the locals were fine with seeing the gynecologist if it wasn’t anything life threatening. This experience taught me you need to adapt to the hand you are given, rather than being adamant on a certain way of doing things; otherwise, you won’t be able to accomplish the tasks at hand. </p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">Last, I learned how not to judge a book by its cover – just because something doesn’t look the way we expect it to doesn’t mean it won’t be good. Case in point was the food I encountered across my travels, which was in stark contrast to what you would normally see in the U.S. For instance, when my friends and I went to Vienna, we ate at this small hole-in-the-wall restaurant. Our server told us that the restaurant’s signature dish was horse meat. None of us had ever seen horse meat on a menu before, and so I gave into my curiosity and ordered it. When the dish arrived, my initial enthusiasm started to wane as the dish didn’t look all that appetizing, but after trying it I was pleasantly surprised. It was really good and ended up being the highlight of my night there, reinforcing the ideas that appearances are often misleading and that you should delve deeper into things before making a judgment. </p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">The 5 months I was in Italy helped me grow leaps and bounds from who I was before I left. Traveling to all these different locations and experiencing all the different locales taught me how to be present in the moment, keep an open mind, and not judge things by their appearance. I believe all these skills help you become well-rounded, because they promote better performance and inspire you to learn new skills. You realize there is always room for growth: There are always skills and lessons to be learned and at no point in life does that stop being true. When traveling, you encounter a diverse range of people and situations, which forces you to adapt and grow. That’s the beauty of travel: No matter where you go or what you experience, it will help develop who you are as a person. </p>\n\n\n<hr size=\"15\">\n<p class=\"bodytext\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http://img.faculty.unlv.edu/lab/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Jeralds-Website-Pic-scaled-e1631220928685.jpg\" alt=\"jd\" width=\"151\" height=\"200\" align=\"left\" hspace=\"5\" vspace=\"1\">Jerald Novero joined the Interactive Measuring Group in Spring 2021.

However, I recently came to the realization that the words I say to myself carry a lot of weight, and by practicing positive self-talk I can uplift myself. Positive self-talk is the angel on my shoulder, encouraging me and telling me to hold my head high. When I practice positive self-talk, I am my biggest supporter, my personal cheerleader, and my helping hand. Cultivating positive thoughts by reciting affirmations improves my mood and gives me a boost of confidence. </p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">I did not always practice positive self-talk; I only recently started using it. Before, I sometimes got overwhelmed in uncomfortable situations. For example, during my presentation on sexual revictimization, I constantly anticipated the worst, thinking that no one would like the presentation. I tensed up and became anxious. After my presentation, I realized that many of my overwhelming thoughts came from what I said to myself. I had to start flipping this narrative: Rather than undermining myself, I had to begin supporting myself. </p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">I started practicing positive self-talk just before my presentation on parental incarceration.  I recited affirmations to myself, whispering, “I worked hard, and everyone will love the information I have to share.” Repeating this affirmation helped calm my nerves and give me confidence. Afterwards, I noticed that practicing positive self-talk had made me a better presenter.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">Learning how to be kind to myself was difficult. It was challenging to learn how to speak to myself in a new way. However, the more I practiced positive self talk and encouraged myself through affirmation, the easier it became. Over time, it became second nature. </p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">When I am facing challenges and starting to feel overwhelmed, I turn inward and affirm myself. I support myself to regain my confidence to overcome tough situations. Using positive self-talk, I am less anxious and more motivated and confident. It used to be easy to put myself down and let negativity overwhelm me.  Positive self-talk lifts me up and keeps the negativity at bay.  Whenever you are starting to feel negative or overwhelmed, I recommend you recite affirmations to yourself out loud or in your head. Positive self talk has helped me tremendously, and it can help you too. </p>\n\n<hr size=\"15\">\n<p class=\"bodytext\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http://img.faculty.unlv.edu/lab/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Shawn-photo-2-DONE-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"jd\" width=\"150\" height=\"200\" align=\"left\" hspace=\"5\" vspace=\"1\">LaShawn is a double major in psychology and criminal justice with a minor in neuroscience.

Its primary purpose is to create a sense of community among current and former lab members by sharing articles that can help fellow lab members achieve their educational, professional, and personal goals. Its secondary purpose is to assist lab members in becoming better writers and better mentors.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"body\">Our newsletter team is here to mentor you as you write an article for <i>Connections</i>. First, we will help you understand the kinds of articles we publish as part of our newsletter. Then we will mentor you – through emails, Word documents, and meetings – as you attempt to create a suitable article. When we successfully mentor you through the process of writing and publishing an article, our primary product is not the article, but you – the author. In other words, we are more concerned with your growth and refinement as a writer than with the publication of your article.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"body\"><a href=\"http://img.faculty.unlv.edu/lab/newsletter/issue-8/how-to-write-an-article-for-connections/\" style=\"color: #b10202 !important; text-decoration: underline !important;\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><font\nstyle=\" color:#b10202;\">In a previous article, </font></a>we provided guidance on how to write an article for <i>Connections</i>. In this new article, we explain who is on the newsletter team and how we will help you become a better writer.  This article will help you understand the editorial process and interact effectively with your editor, so you get the most you can out of this experience. </p>\n\n<big><b>Goals</b></big>\n<p class=\"body\">Our main goal is to mentor you on your writing. This includes: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Guiding you through the editorial process, so you create an article that fits within the guidelines of our newsletter: useful to readers, personal, persuasive, etc.</li>\n<li>Challenging you to clarify your thinking, so you know what you want to say and how to say it.</li>\n<li>Helping you improve your writing skills by providing both encouragement and constructive feedback.</li>\n<li>Encouraging you to make steady progress on your article, despite the difficulty of the task.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<big><b>Roles</b></big>\n<p class=\"body\"><i>Connections</i> is the combined effort of many people. Most semesters, more than a dozen lab members are involved in writing, editing, and publishing articles. Moreover, several lab members take on multiple newsletter roles simultaneously (for example, a lab member can be both an action editor and also a reviewer). Distinguishing between roles can help you figure out who to contact for questions about your article and understand why authors have direct contact with Kim on some articles but not others. </p>\n\n<p class=\"body\"><b>You</b> &#8211; <b>the author</b> are the primary creator of your newsletter article. You select a topic that is important to you, write an article about it, and approve the final content. You also draft and approve your own bio and provide a photo of yourself. You must stand behind every word that is published, because your article will be freely available on the Internet and could potentially be seen by future employers and graduate schools.</p>\n\n<p class=\"body\"><b>The action editors</b> mentor you as you attempt to create an article that is suitable for publication in <i>Connections</i> and that will help you in your future plans. In addition, they help put each article in context by drafting an introduction, finding an appropriate content picture, and asking for your bio and photograph.</p>\n\n<p class=\"body\"><b>Reviewers</b> provide feedback on the articles when asked by you or your action editor. Typically, it’s most helpful to ask for big-picture feedback, but sometimes you might want to ask for sentence-, word-, or punctuation-level feedback.  For ideas about how to get big-picture feedback on your article, see our workshops on Giving and Receiving Feedback and on Keys to Great Writing.</p>\n\n<p class=\"body\"><b>The website coordinator</b> creates article webpages &#8212; like the one you are viewing now &#8212; using an established template to ensure consistent and professional appearance. Their job is to ensure that your article, bio, and photo reflect the content you wanted.  After the newsletter has been emailed to everyone, the website coordinator also creates an index page that looks like that email. They publish these pages on our lab’s website, so your article can be viewed by future lab members and by anyone on the Internet. </p>\n\n<p class=\"body\"><b>The managing editor</b> organizes and tracks work on all articles, making sure that authors and editors are making progress every week.  They also train and mentor new action editors and help any action editor who has questions.  Thus, the managing editor may help with the editing of your article, even if the managing editor is not your action editor.  The managing editor also prepares the article line-up for each newsletter issue, and so they recommend whether your article will appear in the upcoming issue or a later issue.  Finally, the managing editor updates the email list to include new lab members, so that we are distributing your article to all current and past members. </p>\n\n<p class=\"body\"><b>The editor-in-chief</b>, Kim Barchard, provides one round of big-picture feedback on each article early in the editorial process to make sure that the article is heading in an appropriate direction. When she does, you will see her comments among the feedback you receive.  Kim also approves all final content, including the articles, bios, photos, introductions, and content photos. Because she approves the final content, she also copy-edits the content of the articles.  Your action editor will ask you to either approve her copy-edits or make additional changes. </p>\n\n<big><b>How We Will Mentor You</b></big>\n<p class=\"body\">We will mentor you using four main tools: decision letters, Microsoft Word comments and track changes, and meetings.</p>\n<p class=\"body\"><b>Decision letters</b> provide you with big-picture feedback, often including suggestions on what to do next. They are meant to encourage you and keep you motivated. They provide guidance to help you spend your time productively, without telling you how to write your article. Decision letters will be delivered to you in the form of emails.</p>\n<p class=\"body\"><b>Microsoft Word comments</b> provide feedback on specific sections within your article. Your action editor may use comments to ask questions or to point out issues with particular sentences and paragraphs.</p>\n<p class=\"body\"><b>Microsoft Word track changes</b> are used to show suggested changes to the wording of your bio or article.  You can accept or reject our changes or modify the text in some other way.  Remember that our suggestions are just suggestions: You are the author and responsible for the final content.</p>\n<p class=\"body\"><b>Meeting</b> with you allows your action editor to mentor you one-on-one without the communication barriers of email. These meetings may occur at any stage of the editorial process. We can help you pick a topic, help you figure out how to incorporate feedback, or provide guidance and encouragement any time you get stuck. Meeting with you helps us nourish a mentor/mentee relationship, encourages us both to continue making steady progress on the article, and helps clear up any confusion that might have occurred in the written feedback.</p>\n\n<big><b>Final Thoughts</b></big>\n<p class=\"body\">Writing a newsletter article is both challenging and rewarding.  It is challenging because you need to figure out first what you want to say and then how to say it.  It is rewarding because writing an article will help you refine your thinking on a topic that is important to you. It is also rewarding because you will see your writing transform, and the skills you develop will assist you in all your future writing endeavors: conference posters, theses and dissertations, and writing on the job.  For many, a newsletter article is their first professional writing. We’re here to help you get the most you can out of this experience.</p>\n\n<hr size=\"15\">\n<p class=\"bodytext\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http://img.faculty.unlv.edu/lab/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Author-Photo-2-Cassandra-September-20-2021-DONE-1.jpg\" alt=\"cassandra\" width=\"162\" height=\"175\" align=\"left\" hspace=\"5\" vspace=\"4\">Cassandra Hoffman has been a member of the Interactive Measurement Group since the fall of 2020.

My first project was to design a webpage that creates simple data visualizations. Our entire team would use this page to create bar charts, line charts, and scatter plots from the union’s database. To create the page, I had to use JavaScript, CSS, HTML, and PHP – most of which I had no experience in. With diligence, I was able to learn these skills and complete this challenging project. </p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">Each day, I focused on a single task. For example, one of my first goals was to create a bar chart. One day, I would create the drop-down menus. Another, I would reorganize the data based upon the selections. Another, I would create the bar chart itself. Another, I would add a title or legend to the graph. Working on one thing at a time enabled me to work efficiently and accurately. </p>\n\n<p class=\"body\"Additionally, I devoted many hours to learning. When I first started my internship, I had limited programming experience: I only knew a little bit of R and a pinch of C++ from my courses. Therefore, I spent time after work learning the basics of the four languages I needed to use. I used the free coursework from DataCamp and Codecademy to get a basic framework, and I regularly visited Stack Exchange to learn the syntax for each function and to help with problem-solving. These resources helped me program more effectively so that my code was clear, concise, and organized.</p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">Lastly, I pushed myself to complete hard tasks. To reach solutions, I needed to switch to a coding mindset. This mindset includes understanding how each piece of code connects to everything else. To design a piece of code, I had to break it down to its very foundation. First, I needed to consider its required inputs and desired outputs. Then, I needed to consider what I would do with those inputs: how the code would transform the data to create the outputs. As I succeeded on one task after another, I kept setting new goals for myself. </p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">By managing my time, building my skills, and challenging myself, I was able to make considerable progress on my internship projects within a span of four months. As a result, I was offered a permanent full-time position.</p>\n\n<hr size=\"15\">\n<p class=\"bodytext\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http://img.faculty.unlv.edu/lab/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Monica-Lab-Photo.jpg\" alt=\"jd\" width=\"131\" height=\"175\" align=\"left\" hspace=\"5\" vspace=\"1\">Monica Cordova-Medina graduated from UNLV in the Spring of 2021 with a B.A. in Mathematics and a minor in Psychology.

A problem meant that my plan was not going as it should have. It was a setback that shouldn’t have existed. It cluttered the path with difficulties, seemingly for no reason at all. When a problem appeared, I was frustrated that I had to devote time and energy to it, instead of moving towards my goal. Often, just the anticipation of possible problems would stress me out.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">This spring, my poster team ran into a problem. Our graphs weren’t accessible for people with disabilities: We needed to add dashed lines, colors, and shapes. In addition, we needed to fix the legend and axes. And we didn’t know how to do so. At first, I thought of this problem the same way I always do: Another obstacle that was impeding my progress towards my goal. However, that same semester, our lab was reading the book <i>Deep Work</i> by Cal Newport. He defined deep work as “professional activities performed in a state of distraction-free concentration that push your cognitive capabilities to their limit… [allowing you] to wring every last drop of value out of your current intellectual capacity” (p. 5). It seemed like just what I needed to fix our problem. Therefore, I decided to use deep work to fix my poster team’s graphs. </p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">To practice deep work, I set aside 2 hours per day when I would work on the graphs in a distraction-free environment. Seven days a week, 8 a.m. to 10 a.m. First thing, so I couldn’t procrastinate. Before I talked to my parents, so they wouldn’t know I was awake. With the blinds closed and my phone on do-not-disturb, so I wouldn’t be distracted. After removing the possibility of distractions, I started practicing. I used my time to read R statistics manuals and search Google, then played around with the example code. I implemented the new ideas into our graphs.  I pushed myself, working past the point of frustration. I had to sort through a vast number of solutions online, try them out, combine solutions, try them out, and do this some more. The process was repetitive and effortful. One solution would work for our lines but undo the solution for our shapes. I was tempted to give up at times, but I didn’t want to lose the mental flow that comes with uninterrupted deep work. So, rather than allowing myself to be overcome with frustration, I committed to pushing myself until I finally found a solution. And I did. </p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">Using deep work, I was able to make my team’s R graphs just right for our poster. Not only did our graphs have legible axes and legends, but they also had dashed lines, solid lines, colors, and shapes that made them more accessible. In addition, I had learned skills that would help me on future R projects. </p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">I used to see a problem as an enemy because they usually interrupted my plans and made me uncomfortable. Now I see a problem as a friend &#8212; a friend that tells you the honest truth about where you need to improve in order to accomplish your goals. A friend that is there to help you, despite the frustrating way it presents itself. If you accept that frustration, you will find out things you didn’t know before and learn skills that will help you now and in the future.   </p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">The problem with our poster graphs taught me so much this spring. It taught me how to create graphs in R, which is a useful skill for future research projects and graduate school. More generally, it taught me how to code and problem-solve and how to be tenacious. But it also taught me how to truly apply deep work. Before encountering this graph problem, I was already spending a couple of hours per day earning certifications in R. But deep work is more than just dedicating time in a distraction-free environment. It also includes “professional activities… that push your cognitive abilities to their limit,” which allows you to “wring every last drop of value out of your current intellectual capability”. A practical problem that you truly want to solve provides the motivation and focus to make deep work happen. I encourage you to embrace problems as learning opportunities and to face problems using a deep work philosophy. </p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">Reference</p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">Newport, C.

According to Cal Newport, author of <i>Deep Work</i>, quality is a function of the depth in which we work. Deep work occurs when we engross ourselves in a cognitively demanding task – entering a deep state of concentration (without distractions). This, in turn, pushes our intellect and ingenuity beyond their usual limits and allows us to create something of worth. Shallow work, on the other hand, occurs without much conscious effort – often amid distractions – and doesn’t create any real value. Newport asserts that deep work is increasingly rare in our society, while shallow work has become the norm. Consequently, the quality of our work has diminished, and we’re often dissatisfied with what we produce. As I reflected on these ideas, I considered how distractions have affected my ability to do deep work over the years – particularly within the realm of academic writing.   </p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">Any time I have tried to accomplish a writing task in an environment with frequent distractions, composing a good paragraph (let alone a good paper) has felt next to impossible. Perhaps I would be contemplating what I wanted to say and suddenly my dogs would start barking. I’d look up, wondering what they were barking at, and whatever I had been contemplating was lost. Maybe I had already figured out what I wanted to say and was beginning to arrange my ideas on paper just as my roommate started clanking dishes in the kitchen. I would then wonder what she was cooking, think about what I should have for lunch, and then…. wait…. what was I just writing? When I’ve written in this type of environment and tried to think deeply about the content, organization, and flow of my work, I could only focus for a few minutes at a time. If I didn’t get all of my thoughts written down before the next distraction, I would have to start that section all over. I imagine it’s like when a band is trying to record a song in the studio and the lead vocalist keeps singing off key halfway through each take. They might spend hours recording before they finally produce a single quality track. It’s frustrating to say the least. And because interruptions make it difficult to think deeply and develop good ideas, they often lead to mediocre work – lacking in clarity and cohesion.   </p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">On the other hand, when I have tried to accomplish a writing task in the absence of distractions, I’ve been able to compose entire pieces unimpeded. My thoughts flow together in harmony, and I can focus long enough to fully form a creative idea and get it down on paper. If I’m home alone, I can spend several consecutive hours on a piece of writing, taking breaks periodically for contemplation. If I can’t concentrate at home, I might travel to a quiet coffeeshop near the university: A place where students are engrossed in their own work and interruptions are minimal. Writing without frequent environmental distractions enables me to concentrate, think deeply, and write with better quality.   </p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">For instance, when I was tasked with writing an analysis of how schizophrenia is portrayed in <i>A Beautiful Mind</i>, I completed each step of the process while home alone without interruptions. I watched the movie intently, pausing and rewinding as needed, while I took notes and carefully compared my observations to the various symptoms detailed in the DSM-5. I then reflected in silence, organized my thoughts on paper, and spent the remainder of the weekend drafting my analysis. My own assessment of the quality of the writing was confirmed when my professor graded the assignment and handed it back to me with a note that said, “This is one of the best papers I’ve read in a long time.” Writing without distractions helped me ensure I didn’t miss important details and enabled me to orchestrate something that was well-organized, thorough, and insightful. Not only did it earn praise from my professor, but it also left me feeling a deep sense of accomplishment.   </p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">Whether your aim is to write an impressive, thought-provoking paper or to excel at some other difficult project you’ve undertaken, I encourage you try it in an environment free of distractions. Experience the equanimity and sustained attention that come in the absence of repeated interruptions. See how the quality of your work improves when you can think more fluently. Feel how your sense of pride and accomplishment crescendo. Learn firsthand how you, too, can benefit from deep work.  </p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">Reference</p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">Newport, C.

Distractions such as text messages and Facebook notifications can make it difficult to achieve a state of intense concentration, therefore affecting the quality of our work. In <i>Deep Work</i>, Cal Newport argues we need to limit distractions to produce our best work.   </p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">Newport defines deep work as challenging professional activities performed in a state of intense, distraction-free concentration. However, prior to reading Newport’s book, I struggled with reaching a state of intense concentration. Within the first hour of working on a task, I sometimes checked my phone three or four times. One simple notification could encourage me to aimlessly scroll through Facebook and other social media sites.  These off-task activities not only took up time, but also broke my concentration and made it hard to get back to work.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">As a freelance graphic designer, it is important for me both to meet deadlines and to produce high quality work. After reading Newport’s book, I knew distractions were making both those goals harder.  Therefore, I have now adopted a ritual that helps reduce my time social media. Before I start any type of work, I turn off my notifications and put my phone out of sight, for example, in my backpack or across the room. This ritual has helped me create a space that is conducive to deep work. Tasks that used to take an hour now take 20 minutes, and my designs are more eye-catching and polished. By increasing both the speed and quality of my work, reducing distractions has helped my business flourish.  </p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">Reference</p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">Newport, C.

I certainly used to.  When I was 19, my boyfriend lived across from a small neighborhood park.  One sunny Saturday afternoon, I drove out to see him.  The park was full of families on the playground and teenagers playing baseball, so I couldn’t park immediately in front of his house.  I parked just around the corner.  As I got out of my car, another car parked behind me.  The driver came over and complained that I had taken his parking spot. As he berated me, I knew he was unjustified and unreasonable: Residents, visitors, and park users were all expected to use these parking spots.  Nonetheless, I was devastated.  I spent the next hour on my boyfriend’s couch, sobbing and stuttering through my story.  Even though I knew I had done nothing wrong, I was upset because a complete stranger – who I had never met before and would probably never meet again – had criticized me.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"body\"><a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/amberjohnson-jimludema/2019/11/07/criticism-vs-feedback/?sh=1d7cb35d794a\" style=\"color: #b10202 !important; text-decoration: underline !important;\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><font\nstyle=\" color:#b10202;\">Some people</font></a> distinguish between criticism and feedback: They say criticism is hurtful and focused on the past, while feedback is constructive and focused on future improvements.  However, I did not make that distinction when I was 19.  I felt hurt and defensive even when well-meaning people tried to help me improve.  For example, I could be reduced to tears by a teacher writing next to one of my paragraphs, “Please clarify.”  In both my personal life and at school, I looked for evidence that I was wonderful, and I was devastated by any comment implying that I or my work were less than perfect. Thus, I did not seek out feedback, and when teachers and supervisors provided it, I tried to ignore it. </p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">A decade and a half later, I attended a full-day workshop entitled Publish and Flourish.  The presenter, Tara Gray, explained <a href=\"https://teaching.nmsu.edu/publish-flourish.html\" style=\"color: #b10202 !important; text-decoration: underline !important;\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><font\nstyle=\" color:#b10202;\">systematic methods</font></a>  of obtaining writing feedback and concrete steps to solve the identified problems.  For me, this was a turning point.  I came to love feedback.  I learned that writers know too much about their topics to identify sections that need more background, but that real readers can identify those sections easily.  I discovered that feedback can help me identify the sections that need the most work, so I don’t waste time polishing material that is already good.  I realized that the only way to know if others find my writing understandable and persuasive is to ask others to read it.  I learned that I don’t have to follow others’ advice about my writing: It’s the reader’s job to identify issues, but it’s my job to fix them. </p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">Now that I know how to ask for feedback and what to do with it, I seek out feedback on most of my work.  I seek mentors who know more than me.  I seek collaborators for problem-solving.  I ask for feedback on my syllabi and assignments and course schedules.  Two minds really are better than one.  Feedback is a way of getting others to do some of my work, but in a more powerful way than just trading one hour of my time for one hour of theirs.  Having different perspectives allows me to strengthen my work in ways that wouldn’t be possible if I just spent more time on each project myself.  Feedback helps me learn and improve. </p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">However, some feedback is more useful than others.  I now distinguish between five kinds of feedback.  First, there are on-target comments, in which someone identifies a potential weakness in my work.  When I receive an on-target comment, I use it to improve my work.  I start by deciding if I agree with the comment.  If I do, I address the problem as best I can and then send my work to others to see if the issue remains.  For example, maybe a reader found one paragraph boring: I would check for passive voice, wordiness, and strings of prepositional phrases, and I would try to increase organization, flow, and concrete examples. </p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">If I initially disagree with a comment, I use a systematic process to overcome my defensiveness, so I can still use the comment to improve my work.  First, I try to understand the comment.  For example, I might read the comment multiple times, while reviewing the parts of my work that they are referring to.  If the comment comes from someone I know personally, I might ask follow-up questions.  Next, I write the ideas down in my own words, as clearly as I can.  Finally, I return to the comment later to see if I can use it somehow.  Sometimes, I find that I’m more receptive to the comment an hour later or a week later.  For example, maybe I think the lack of parallelism in a sentence is okay, even though one reader found it problematic: I realize that introducing parallelism is feasible and that the revised sentence is no worse than the original, and so I make the change.  Sometimes, I still disagree with the comment an hour or two later, the next day, or the next week.  In that case, I try to identify nearby problems that may have tripped up the reader.  For example, perhaps a reader suggested a punctuation or wording substitution, and I realize the sentence is not concise.  Or perhaps the reader said a sentence was too long, and I realize the paragraph has an unclear organizational structure.  Thus, when I disagree with an on-target comment, I still use it to improve my work, though sometimes not in the way the feedback-giver intended.</p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">Second, there are overwhelming comments, in which someone identifies a real issue, but it’s too much work for me to fix.  In one sense, overwhelming comments are just another example of on-target comments, but they are different emotionally and practically.  For example, maybe someone identified a critical flaw in my research design and said I need to re-do my entire study, or maybe someone suggested a better way of analyzing my data, but I don’t know that technique.  When I receive an overwhelming comment, I feel hurt and inadequate.  Nonetheless, I address these comments using the same steps as other comments: I write them down, figure out what the solution is, and list the necessary steps to make that solution happen. Sometimes I am able to inch towards that solution, either by taking one small step at a time or by getting help from others.  Other times, I alter my goals.  For example, rather than re-doing the study, I add a paragraph about limitations and then submit to a lower-tiered journal.  Whether I solve the problem or change my goals, initially overwhelming comments become less overwhelming because I know what I need to do: read the feedback, comprehend it, write it down. </p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">Third, there are off-target comments, in which someone says something that is completely irrelevant to my work.  For example, they might comment about the children in our study, when in fact our participants were adults; or they might comment about the categories we used, when in fact our variables were continuous.  When I receive an off-target comment, I recognize that my writing was unclear and try to identify why the reader was confused.  Then I fix the apparent cause of the problem and send my work to others to see if the confusion remains.  To partially forestall off-topic comments, I ask early readers to identify the paper’s main point.  If their answer does not correspond to what I was trying to say, I look for material that strays from my main point, and I remove it.  I also reorganize sentences, paragraphs, and the entire paper to create a stronger, more focused story-line. </p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">Fourth, there are personal attacks, in which someone says something bad about me as a person.  For example, they might say that I am lazy or ignorant or that this is obviously the very first article I’ve ever written.  When I receive a personal attack, I try to identify the weaknesses in my work that lead to that comment, and then I address those weaknesses as best I can.  In other words, I try to interpret personal attacks as on-target comments – just ones that were not expressed very clearly.  Being able to address the root cause of such comments takes out their sting.  If I cannot tie the comments back to my work, then I simply put them aside: Those comments are more about the speaker than about me. </p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">Finally, there are compliments.  For example, sometimes reviewers describe both strengths and weaknesses of my papers.  And sometimes when I ask students for feedback, they provide compliments before identifying sections that need work.  How I feel about compliments and what I do after receiving them depends upon when they are received.  If I receive a compliment on my finished work, I feel pride and joy.  I treasure these compliments and often keep them so I can savor them again in the future.  If I receive a compliment on work that is nearly finished, I feel hope.  Compliments suggest I’m almost done.  I put the compliments aside and look for things I still need to improve.  Finally, if I receive a compliment when I asked for feedback, I feel disappointment.  I wanted help improving my work and compliments do not help me improve.  I look through the rest of the feedback for comments that can help me. </p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">Reading this article, you might be thinking, “It was interesting to hear that you learned to love feedback and so are able to use it to improve your work.  But how does that help me?  How can I learn to love feedback?”  I recommend you take control of the feedback process.  Deliberately ask for feedback on low-stakes material, like newsletter articles, answers to graduate school interview questions, and drafts of term papers, so you don’t feel stressed about getting it perfect.  Ask for feedback early in the writing process, when you know your work isn’t finished, so you can view that feedback as a way of helping you write more efficiently.  Ask for feedback often, so you can check whether your revisions have addressed the previous problems, and so you can receive the reward of noticing that feedback is improving your work.  Ask for feedback from people who like you, so you are able to view the feedback as well-intended.  Finally, ask for feedback to identify problems rather than solutions: Pay attention to any suggestions you receive (and even feel free to ask for those suggestions), but remember that getting feedback and suggestions does not reduce your responsibility for the final product. </p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">In addition to obtaining as much friendly feedback as you can, I also recommend you take every opportunity to provide feedback to others.  By providing feedback, you’ll come to learn how much caring and effort is involved.  Knowing this will make you more generous and forgiving when someone does not express their feedback as diplomatically or clearly as they could.  This will help you look benevolently on the feedback you receive and thus contribute to you learning to love feedback. </p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">Once you’ve learned to deal proactively with well-intended feedback from friends and allies, you’ll be better able to benefit from feedback from others.  You’ll benefit from feedback from instructors, thesis committee members, and reviewers, whose good intentions you might not naturally assume.  You may even benefit from comments from strangers who clearly do not have your well-being at heart.  Regardless of the comments’ source, you’ll squeeze as much benefit from them as you can and set the rest aside.  Like me, you may be able to receive feedback without feeling hurt or defensive. </p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">A few years after attending that momentous workshop, I was walking my dog in town when I saw a loose dog.  It came around the corner, with no leash and no owner in sight.  I didn’t know if that dog was friendly or not, and so I crossed the street to get further away.  Then the owner – a tall, white-haired man – appeared from around a bush.  He stepped closer and berated me for having crossed the street.  He was affronted at the implied criticism.  He yelled that his dog – now quietly sniffing a bush twenty feet behind him – was better behaved than mine.  After a couple of minutes, he stopped yelling, and I continued on my way.  As I walked, I thought with sympathy about all the things that might have led him to react so strongly.  I also thought of all the good reasons people might cross a street to avoid being too close to another dog.  I did not feel sad or hurt; I did not cry.  In the years since this man yelled at me, I have thought about this incident several times and have always concluded that crossing the street was a fine thing to do.  When I see off-leash dogs now, I still cross the street.  Indeed, I often cross the street when I see on-leash dogs if the sidewalk isn’t very wide.  But I have learned to smile broadly when I do so and yell a cheery hello.</p>\n\n<hr size=\"15\">\n<p class=\"bodytext\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http://img.faculty.unlv.edu/lab/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Barchard-2021-crop-DONE-999x1024-1.jpg\" alt=\"jd\" width=\"175\" height=\"212\" align=\"left\" hspace=\"5\" vspace=\"2\">Kimberly A.

We quickly learned that sleep-deprived students would be jarred awake by the teacher’s obnoxiously loud voice or the sound of a metal yardstick crashing onto the tile floor. At the time, we students would laugh hysterically watching this happen to others.  Since I saw sleep scientist Matthew Walker on the Joe Rogan Experience, I now see the situation very differently. Starting school before 7 a.m. led many of us to be regularly sleep deprived; it’s no surprise many of us students struggled to stay attentive and awake during class. . Hearing Walker talk about how crucial sleep is to a healthy life ignited my curiosity, so I went on to read his book, <i>Why We Sleep</i>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">My biggest takeaway from <i>Why We Sleep</i> is the importance of a consistent sleep schedule that allows one to get eight hours of sleep per night. Before reading Walker’s book, I assumed that poor sleep throughout the week could be made up for on the weekends. However, Walker explains that sleep for memory consolidation is an all-or-nothing event: Attempting to pay off one’s sleep debt later does not work. To consolidate memories acquired throughout the day and make room for tomorrow’s new memories, one needs to get eight hours of sleep. Waking up and going to bed at the same times each day is the best way of ensuring one gets eight hours: This reinforces one’s sleep schedule into their circadian rhythm. </p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">Incorporating a consistent sleep schedule that works harmoniously with one’s waking schedule requires planning.  As a college student, I am lucky that I often have multiple options for class start times. I am not naturally an early riser, so I’ve built my school schedules starting after 10 a.m. Doing so has dramatically improved my retention of information, academic performance, and engagement in classes. In the future, however, life circumstances may force me to wake up earlier. When those circumstances arise, I will need to shift my sleep schedule earlier. To consistently get eight hours of sleep, I’ll have to go to bed earlier in order to wake up earlier every day of the week. </p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">A consistent sleep schedule is not the only thing one can do to improve one’s sleep.  Walker mentions that eating meals before bed can cause indigestion, leading to poorer sleep quality. As I sometimes eat dinner too close to my bedtime, I am working on being more thoughtful and deliberate with my meal scheduling so that I’ll feel more refreshed and attentive during the day. Walker also recommends people avoid using electronic devices an hour before bed, as they emit blue light that confuses our circadian rhythm. I used to lay in bed at night, flooding my eyes with light from YouTube videos. It would take me hours to fall asleep and I would wake up with a headache, feeling groggy, dull, and irritable. I’ve found that listening to podcasts allows me to unwind without being exposed to blue light. I fall asleep easier and wake up so much more refreshed. </p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">Learning about healthy sleep habits is important, but incorporating that knowledge into your own life is what matters most. Doing so can be difficult and often requires large adjustments to your current habits. The most important aspect of healthy sleep is a consistent sleep schedule that works with your waking schedule and allows you to get a full eight hours of sleep. Try to fit the sleep puzzle piece precisely and accurately into the bigger picture of your life. When does your body want to go to sleep and when does it want to wake up?  Can you adjust your work, school, and recreational schedule to accommodate your circadian rhythm? What adjustments would be needed to have consistent wake and sleep times every day?  Finally, consider how the activities you partake in before bed affect your sleep and adjust them as necessary. By prioritizing sleep and building better habits around it, your mental and physical well-being will improve, allowing you to live your best life. </p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">Reference</p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">Walker, M.

I enrolled in two of the hardest math courses for my degree and assumed many leadership roles within my student organization and research lab. I was doing everything I wanted to do at the time however, I underestimated my workload. By the middle of that semester, everything intensified: My courses became more rigorous in content, I was coordinating an all-day virtual philanthropy event, and leading a poster team for the first time. I was overwhelmed and stressed. To alleviate my stress, I practiced a breathing exercise I learned from reading Jon Kabat-Zinn’s <i>Full Catastrophe Living</i> and reducing my stress enabled me to better manage my workload. </p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">To practice the breathing exercise, I followed four simple steps that I learned from <i>Full Catastrophe Living</i>: I set my timer to fifteen minutes, sat in a comfortable position, closed my eyes, and became aware of the flow of my breathing. If I ever struggled with focusing on my breathing because I was dwelling on my many responsibilities, it helped to follow Kabat-Zinn’s advice: Think of your thoughts as clouds passing by and focus on the movement of your belly with every breath. As I focused on my breathing, I detached myself from overwhelming thoughts and, by the end of the exercise, felt less stressed. Throughout my final fall semester, I practiced this exercise multiple times a day.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">Because I felt less stressed, I could focus on managing my workload. I built a system where I parsed my work &#8212; each day having a specific focus. For instance, Tuesdays would be the day that I’d finish most, if not all, of my math assignments. Wednesdays would be my lab days, Sundays my extracurricular days, and so on. Each day, I made sure to take breaks, and, if I ever found myself feeling stressed, I practiced the breathing exercise. This system helped me attend to my workload and get stuff done &#8212; all while managing my stress. </p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">I ended that semester with many successes: I passed the two courses, hosted the <a href=\"http://img.faculty.unlv.edu/lab/newsletter/issue-13/monica-glow-spotlight/\" style=\"color: #b10202 !important; text-decoration: underline !important;\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><font style=\" color:#b10202;\">virtual philanthropy event</font></a>, and presented a poster on censored data analysis with my poster team. Although I experienced stress throughout the semester, I am glad I was able to manage it with something as simple as breathing. </p>\n\n\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">Reference</p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">Kabat-Zinn, J.

With this shift, meditation practices such as mindfulness exercises are becoming the norm. People engage in these activities with the intention of awakening from an unconscious state of programmed thoughts and behaviors to an ideal state of consciousness. Becoming conscious allows people to experience less anger, stress, and tension. They also enjoy more peace, happiness, and enjoyment. Intrigued by these benefits, I looked for resources that would help me improve my mental wellbeing and arrive at a more awakened state. In Eckhart Tolle’s <i>A New Earth: Awakening to Your Life’s Purpose</i>, I learned that refraining from labeling things as good or bad, separating myself from my emotions, and incorporating mindfulness practices into everyday activities can help me become conscious. </p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">Throughout my life, I have been taught that certain things are good while others are bad. Furthermore, I have developed programmed responses to both labels. For example, I have experienced the annoyance of traffic as I rush to get to my first class of the day. Traffic is on my list of bad things, so I respond accordingly: I get frustrated, let out a huff to express my discontent, and ruminate on the idea that traffic is absolutely bad. To make matters worse, I refuse to accept my circumstance, and my resistance to the traffic makes me feel even more angry and stressed. According to Tolle, these negative emotions do not come from the traffic, but from my perception of the traffic as unfavorable. I do not intentionally choose to respond that way; instead, I am asleep to my automatic thoughts and behaviors. In Tolle’s words – I am unconscious. To come out of this state, Tolle advises not labeling things as good or bad and to fully accept what is happening in each present moment (in my case – the traffic). By not applying any labels to my present situation and freely allowing it to occur, I gain awareness and peace. </p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">Another way I can become unconscious is when I allow my thoughts and emotions to take control of me. For example, I often feel stress and tense when I go through my syllabi at the beginning of the semester. Feelings of intimidation, doubt, and anxiety fill my mind as I review the required readings, papers, and exams that I will need to complete during the semester. My heart pounds like a jackhammer, my head spins like a washing machine, and my body sweats like a long-distance runner. I become so overwhelmed that I induce headaches and backaches. To minimize these consequences, Tolle instructs us to be alert at the onset of a negative emotion. Now, as soon as I receive a syllabus and start feeling stressed I take a moment to observe what I am experiencing. I recognize that I am stressed, but I do not allow it to consume me. In other words, I become aware that I am not my emotions and that what I am feeling does not define who I am. Just by becoming aware of my negative thoughts, those unwanted feelings naturally subside and my aches and pains start to dissipate. </p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">Reaching a level of awareness takes much practice, but according to Tolle, awareness becomes easier if you apply it to everyday mundane behaviors. When I eat meals between studying, I now try to be mindful. I turn off my computer screen, close my books, and remind myself that multi-tasking depletes the energy needed to be fully conscious in the present. I focus on every component of the eating experience: I recognize the varying shades of green of each romaine leaf, the crunchy texture of croutons, the aroma of the recently heated chicken breast, and the salty and potent taste of the Caesar dressing. Whenever I catch my mind wandering off to thinking about how I will resume my studies, I bring myself back to awareness by concentrating on my lunch. By applying the same consciousness to drinking tea, walking to the mailbox, and brushing my teeth, I have found more enjoyment and happiness in these daily activities. </p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">As thinking beings, we tend to bring unnecessary stress into our lives. We fall asleep as we allow labels to govern how we feel, permit negative emotions to take over our entire being, and deprive ourselves of the many opportunities to live a more peaceful life – one that can be attained by becoming conscious. Tolle’s principles and methods have opened my eyes to the many possibilities that awareness brings. </p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">Reference</p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">Tolle, E.

Sometimes we don’t expect it, and sometimes we are scared of it, but change will come, nonetheless. One thing I have learned for certain, though, is that refusing to acknowledge or adapt to changes can be harmful, as it can cause us to miss out on rewarding opportunities. Thankfully, Spencer Johnson’s <i>Who Moved My Cheese?</i> helped me identify four major steps for facing change: anticipate change, accept change, adapt to change, and enjoy change. After reflecting on Johnson’s insights, I’ve realized the importance of some of the changes I made as an undergraduate &#8212; and the continued importance of being able to face change.   </p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">The first thing I keep in mind is that change can happen at any moment; therefore, I must <i>anticipate</i> change. I admit that I wasn’t always good at anticipating changes. For example, during my freshman year of college, I stuck to a simple routine: I would go to class and then go home. I was getting good grades, so I figured my approach to college was setting me up for success. The summer following my freshman year, however, I learned that being actively involved in extracurriculars is just as important as good grades when it comes to getting into graduate school. This information shook my world because it made me realize that my simple routine would not cut it for graduate school applications. I had not <i>anticipated</i> change.</p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">\nEven though I failed to anticipate change, I was quick to <i>accept</i> that I needed to change my routine. If I wanted to stand a chance at getting into a graduate program, I needed to get involved in extracurriculars. Therefore, the summer following my freshman year, I visited UNLV’s <a href=\"https://involvementcenter.unlv.edu\" style=\"color: #b10202 !important; text-decoration: underline !important;\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><font\nstyle=\" color:#b10202;\">Involvement Center</font></a> and <a href=\"https://www.unlv.edu/psychology/labs\" style=\"color: #b10202 !important; text-decoration: underline !important;\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><font\nstyle=\" color:#b10202;\">Department of Psychology</font></a> websites to learn about the various clubs and research labs on campus. By the beginning of my sophomore year, I had joined UNLV’s French Club, UNLV’s Psychology Club, and the Interactive Measurement Group. Had I not accepted that I needed to make a change, I’m not sure if I would’ve ever joined these amazing organizations.</p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">The third step, <i>adapting</i> to change, was the most challenging for me. I went from being in auditoriums with 50-70 other students to being in a room with 10 highly motivated lab mates. I went from hour-long lectures to three-hour-long collaborative meetings. In my classes, I was used to blending into crowded lecture halls and never speaking up or taking initiative. That simply wouldn’t do anymore – especially in the lab. So I adapted my routine to allow me to dedicate more time to my extracurriculars: I cut back my hours at work,  I spent more time on campus, I attended all lab meetings, and I showed up to most club events. By my second semester as an active member, I was used to the pace and workload – and I was even ready to adapt again: I accepted multiple leadership roles in the lab and applied to Psi Chi. Had I not adapted in the first place, I would still just be another face in the crowd.</p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">Lastly, it is important to <i>enjoy</i> change. Lots of good things can come from change – they sure did for me! Compared to three years ago, I feel much more confident in my writing, public speaking, and organization skills. I have even learned statistical analyses that aren’t typically taught until graduate school. Indeed, I have come to <i>enjoy</i> change because I have learned new skills, made great friends in the lab and clubs, and can count on the mentorship of my club advisors and Dr. Barchard.  If I would’ve continued simply going to class then going home, I would’ve missed out on these rewarding experiences and connections. </p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">Since joining the lab, I have come across new challenges that require some sort of change every semester, but now I have a helpful set of steps to help me face changes. I can apply the four steps I learned from Johnson to every situation – no matter how big or small a change is needed. For example, early in 2020 Dr. Barchard and I <i>anticipated</i> the possibility of going remote weeks before the pandemic forced us into a lockdown. Even though the rapid spread of COVID-19 surprised many of us, it was crucial for us to <i>accept</i> our new reality (we could not stop nor deny the pandemic), and to <i>adapt</i> to the situation (we had to figure out how to run the lab remotely). Though we faced many hardships, it was still important for me to <i>enjoy</i> the good parts along the way: we expanded our lab, we improved our communication and technology skills, and we even reduced our carbon footprint by not driving to campus regularly!  </p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">During my freshman year, I used to be scared of change because I was comfortable with my simple routine. After accepting that I need to change the way I was approaching college, however, my undergraduate journey became much more rewarding. Today, I continue following Johnson’s philosophy: I anticipate change, I accept change, I adapt to change, and I enjoy change. I know these steps will help me in graduate school, at work, and in all other aspects of life. They may help you, too. If you have ever found yourself struggling to deal with changes, I highly suggest reading Spencer Johnson’s <i> Who Moved My Cheese? </i> </p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">Reference</p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">Johnson, S. (1998). <i>Who moved my cheese?: An amazing way to deal with change in your work and in your life</i>.

I have meditated off and on for most of my life, and I have read many books on Buddhist, Vedic, and Taoist philosophy. I am fascinated with the accounts of long-term meditators experiencing altered states of consciousness, including self-transcendence and feelings of oneness with the universe. Thus, as I approached the end of my undergraduate career, I seized the opportunity to do an honors thesis exploring meditation’s effect on sense of self. See the Appendix to read my thesis abstract.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">Step by step, I formed a research question, designed a study, applied for and received IRB approval, recruited participants, analyzed data in R, and wrote up results in an APA-style document. In April 2021, I successfully defended my thesis before my committee: Dr. Kim Barchard, Professor Jaclyn Costello, and Dr. Paul Nelson. Then in May, I presented my research during a podium presentation at the <a href=\"http://oursymposium.sites.unlv.edu/program/lovingkindness-meditation-alters-sense-of-self-in-non-meditators/\" style=\"color: #b10202 !important; text-decoration: underline !important;\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><font\nstyle=\" color:#b10202;\">Office of Undergraduate Research Virtual Undergraduate Research Symposium</font></a>. In the near future, I plan to submit my research for publication in an academic journal. This thesis project greatly improved my writing, research, and data analysis skills, but it also taught me about patience, perseverance, and fortitude. I proved to myself that I can overcome obstacles that seem overwhelming.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">I ran into instances where I felt like giving up. For example, I ran into trouble when I attempted to set up automatic payments for my participants. I was attempting to recruit participants through Amazon Mechanical Turk (Mturk), a site that gives companies and researchers access to a pool of freelance workers who complete tasks that only human beings can do. In my IRB proposal, I said I would pay participants automatically, as soon as they completed my study. However, all the information I found on setting up automatic payments was outdated. I became increasingly frustrated; I spent over 50 hours trying to solve this one problem and made no progress. The deadline for data collection was approaching fast and I was falling behind. There was no clear path forward. I repeatedly contemplated giving up. Yet I persevered: I read academic and non-academic articles, learned about Amazon Web Services, completed tutorials, and searched for alternative options. I kept pushing, and trying, and searching for a solution. Fortunately, my persistence paid off. I found a site, CloudResearch, that adds functionality to Mturk studies: They would solve my immediate problem of paying participants automatically and they included additional features that simplified the set-up process. I made the deadline for data collection three days early and learned an important lesson about perseverance in the face of challenges.    </p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">This is only one example among many: Each step of the research process had its own trials and accompanying lessons. I took five months to settle on a research question, which taught me about patience. I went through multiple rounds of IRB revisions, which taught me about persistence. I had to solve several problems with my R code, which taught me about fortitude. I incorporated feedback from mentors and peers, which taught me about community. As I overcame each obstacle, I learned that I have what it takes to push myself beyond my previous limits and to grow – both as a researcher and as an individual. Each of these lessons has enriched my life, an irreplaceable reward for tackling such an ambitious project.   </p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">Completing an honors thesis has been the most challenging and rewarding experience of my undergraduate career. I am grateful for all that I learned over the last year and half working with Dr. Barchard and my committee members. I consider the honors thesis to be the pinnacle of my university accomplishments – the achievement of a long-term goal that I will remember for the rest of my life. If you are considering doing an honors thesis, know that it is one of the most challenging things you can do as an undergraduate and also one of the most rewarding. </p>\n\n<hr size=\"15\">\n<p class=\"bodytext\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http://img.faculty.unlv.edu/lab/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/JD-Author-Photo-new-DONE-681x1024-1.jpg\" alt=\"jd\" width=\"141\" height=\"212\" align=\"left\" hspace=\"5\" vspace=\"1\">J.D. Watt joined the Interactive Measurement Group in Summer 2019. During his time in the lab, he co-authored two conference posters, an invited talk at a teaching conference, and ten published statistics assignments. He was also our Lab Manager for three semesters, when we innovated extensively to adapt to an online format and simultaneously expand the size of our lab.  J.D. recently graduated <i>summa cum laude</i> from UNLV with his Bachelor of Arts in Psychology. He will be attending General Assembly’s Software Engineering Immersive Remote this summer to learn the skills he needs to pursue his goal of becoming a software developer.

Not us.  We’ve been a hybrid lab for more than a decade, exchanging dozens of emails per week and holding Skype meetings as necessary.  In effect, we’ve been straddling the border between in-person and online.  When in-person meetings became impossible, we launched ourselves boldly into a completely virtual space.  We switched to online meetings, first using WebEx, then Zoom.  After a few months, we also moved from the X drive to WebCampus, relocating our workshops and assignments to make them easier to access and using online discussions and posts to facilitate communication throughout the week. </p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">Most other labs closed and stayed closed.  Few labs were suited to the virtual environment and the physical labs that re-opened had to follow strict operating procedures with minimal on-site personnel.  These circumstances created a terrible shortage of openings for undergraduates wanting research experience.  Thus we found ourselves, last summer and fall, receiving an unprecedented number of applications from people who wanted to join our lab.  We scrambled to interview them all: Multiple people stepped up to complete the meetings and offer their evaluations.  The applicants were excellent.  Rather than telling them to put their plans on hold or attempt graduate school, law school, or medical school without the usual research experience, we decided to substantially increase the number of research assistants in our lab.  This was a daunting prospect.  We spent hours and hours drafting and critiquing proposals, posing and modifying and rejecting ideas.  Our efforts paid off.  Over the last year, we have tripled the number of people in our lab.  We went from 10 people at our lab meetings in Summer 2020 to 28 in Spring 2021.  And we did this while holding all meetings virtually.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"body\">To make this transition, we created a self-contained one-semester research experience, consisting of activities we have used for years, but assembled into a condensed format.  We selected activities that would build foundational skills needed for graduate school, law school, and medical school, and that would be manageable, practical, and safe with many people.  We also used many outside resources, such as online training from DataCamp, workshops from Psi Chi, and books containing exercises and answers.  With extensive discussion and feedback, we were able to find ways to substantially increase the number of new lab members, without reducing the quality of the experience for returning lab members.  However, we had to make several adaptations. </p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">First, we had to adapt our approach in order to create a sense of community, especially among lab members who have never met in person.  When meetings are on campus, people often interact outside of those meetings.  During breaks, people stop working, but they still hang out and chat.  After meetings, people often walk to their cars together.  This makes it easy for people to get to know each other.  But when meetings are online, people rarely interact outside of those meetings: They show up on time, leave on time, and walk away from their cameras during breaks. </p>\n\n<p class=\"body\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http://img.faculty.unlv.edu/lab/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/lab-members-spring-2021.jpg\" width=\"350\" height=\"350\" align=\"right\" hspace=\"5\" vspace=\"5\"></p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">To create a sense of community, we had to deliberately build it in.  We learned to schedule open lab times when members could work on whatever projects they wanted, and we scheduled unscripted discussions where students could talk about topics of interest.  Similarly, lab managers and trainers started to hang out before and after meetings to answer questions, chat, and socialize, and we created a labelled “Break Room” within Zoom where people could socialize.  Such unscripted interactions allow people to get to know each other better.  For example, some people discovered shared interests in hiking and chess, and others discovered shared concerns about climate impacts.  Building upon this, we let members choose whom they would work with, so they could build friendships to support each other, sympathizing with each others’ struggles  over this difficult year and encouraging each other to study for the GRE or take time for workouts.  Moreover, we embedded trainers within the breakout rooms where people were working, so new and returning members could get to know each other.  In the future, each trainer will work with fewer students for more weeks, increasing these interpersonal bonds.  This way, new members will have a better sense of vision about what the lab is, how they contribute to it, and how they can develop their skills over time.  Hopefully, they will see that they, too, could be giving hour-long workshops, leading poster teams, and chairing meetings; they will see how they are a part of this community and can grow within it. </p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">Creating a sense of community was not the only thing we had to do differently.  We also had to change how we structured our meetings in order to make them feel like a lab.  When we have a physical lab space, members often drop off their bags in the morning and hang out between classes.  The lab is something they belong to, something they are in, a part of their identity.  But when we are in virtual meetings, it can be hard to tell the difference between a lab meeting and a class. </p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">To make our virtual meetings feel like a lab, we empowered members to do their best, rather than regulating them to meet required minimums.  We used to have a scheduled break half-way through the meeting, but recently we told lab members they could take breaks whenever they needed.  Some people continued to take one break at the half-way point; others took two shorter breaks.  Some walked away from their cameras; others hung out in the Break Room or main room, talking with each other about hobbies and graduate school.  We are pleased with the wide variety of strategies that lab members have taken to stay alert and productive and to make the meetings enjoyable, enriching experiences.  Similarly, we told lab members that we expected them to participate in meetings, but they could leave their webcams off, if needed.  Indeed, unstable internet connections mean that having your camera on can actually reduce your participation because you get kicked out of the meeting.  We trusted lab members to problem-solve and adapt in order to participate as best they could – with or without their webcams.  To assist new members in envisioning their future and identifying the steps needed to achieve their ambitions, returning members met with new members to discuss their educational and career goals.  Within lab meetings, we encouraged students to personalize their projects to their own interests and allowed them to opt out of activities they did not find beneficial.  We trusted their judgments about what would be valuable for them and what would fit into their crowded schedules.  Along with the unscripted discussions and open lab time, these steps made our virtual meetings feel more like a research lab. </p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">Lastly, we had to adapt our training methods, because the virtual meetings have made it harder to communicate.  When we teach new skills in a physical computer lab, communication is easy.  Trainers start at the front of the room so they can give an overview, pointing at things on the big screen.  As people work, trainers walk around the room, looking at people’s monitors and answering questions.  People problem-solve by calling on other lab members for help – often literally, by talking loudly to someone across the room.  However, this approach is insufficient in an online environment, where people are isolated inside breakout rooms: Trainers are unable to see and hear the frustration from people running into problems, and trainees are unable to hear what the trainer is saying to others. </p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">Therefore, we adjusted our activities to improve communication.  We had trainers provide more up-front instruction before students move into their breakout rooms, and we recruited a third trainer so we could embed one within each group.  This way, students get more of the help they need, faster.  We also asked everyone to answer a short survey at the end of each Monday meeting.  This gave us a better sense of what was working well and what issues were coming up.  For example, this is how we recognized that Monday meetings felt more like a class than a lab.  Finally, every three or four weeks, we held Collaborative Vision Meetings, during which we tackled complex organizational issues.  At first, these meetings included only managers and trainers, but later we included anyone who wanted to participate.  We built upon each other’s creative ideas, envisioning and engendering our inter-dependent future together. </p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">We are looking forward to gathering again in our physical lab when UNLV returns to in-person classes.  Nonetheless, we plan to continue offering a lot of training online.  Online training is more accessible for students with tight schedules, and it allows us to have more lab members than we could fit within our physical space.  We will continue to innovate in order to maximize both the number of students who can participate and the value that each person takes from their lab experiences.  Expanding our lab has allowed us not just to help more students move towards their post-baccalaureate ambitions, but also to grow as instructors and mentors. </p>\n\n\n<hr size=\"15\">\n<p class=\"bodytext\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http://img.faculty.unlv.edu/lab/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Barchard-2021-crop-DONE-999x1024-1.jpg\" alt=\"kim\" width=\"175\" height=\"200\" align=\"left\" hspace=\"5\" vspace=\"5\">Kimberly A.

Watt</em></p>\n<table border=\"0\" width=\"814\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p class=\"body\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http://img.faculty.unlv.edu/lab/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/JD-ContentPhoto4-DONE.jpg\"  width=\"383\" height=\"260\" align=\"right\" hspace=\"5\" vspace=\"19\"></p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">For most of my life, I struggled to maintain healthy habits and consistent productivity. Without clear techniques to change my behavior, I felt at the mercy of my impulses, accomplishing my goals only when I happened to muster the right motivation. Fortunately, I stumbled on a podcast that introduced me to James Clear and his book <i>Atomic Habits: An Easy &#038; Proven Way to Build Good Habits &#038; Break Bad Ones</i>. In <i>Atomic Habits</i>, James Clear outlines four laws of habit change: make it obvious, make it attractive, make it easy, and make it satisfying. Using these four laws and their associated techniques, I took a good hard look at my habits and restructured them to be maximally effective. As a result, I have revolutionized my routine, engineering my life to be productive, healthy, and satisfying.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">The first law, make it obvious, is about setting up the right cues so the behavior you want to do is regularly invoked. Two of the techniques Clear recommends are <i>implementation intentions</i> and <i>habit stacking. Implementation intentions</i> are phrases that specify the action, time, and location for where you will perform the desired behavior. The given formula is: “I will [BEHAVIOR] at [TIME] in [LOCATION].” Before reading this book, I was inconsistent about when I would start tasks. Without the specificity of how I would tackle my workload, there were some days I would get distracted and fail to get important things done. Using this formula, I now better specify when and where I will start working each day. For example, “I will start schoolwork at 11 am in my desk chair.” After setting this intention, my behavior became more consistent, and my productivity increased. </p>\n\n<p class=\"body\"><i>Habit stacking</i>, which involves placing one habit after another, is useful for systemizing your habits. The habit stacking formula is “After [CURRENT HABIT], I will [NEW HABIT].” This technique has completely changed how I organize my life each day. Previously, I had a checklist of things I wanted to do: if they all got done, I was happy. However, I was inconsistently practicing healthy behaviors like meditation and exercise. After reading the book, I wrote down all the habits I wanted to maintain each day and systemized them, so they always follow the same order. Now, it is a rare day when I fail to complete all my planned activities. Writing down my implementation intentions and systemizing them using habit stacking has helped me engineer a more consistent routine that is productive and satisfying.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">The second law, make it attractive, involves making a desired behavior more exciting to perform. One useful technique is <i>temptation bundling</i>, where you pair up the desired behavior with an action you enjoy doing. This increases the likelihood that you will adopt that new behavior. For example, I wanted to start taking vitamin supplements to improve my health. Following the first law, I kept my vitamins on my bedside table where they were obvious. However, because I did not have any water in my bedroom, this habit didn’t stick. After reading about temptation bundling, I decided to pair taking my vitamins with an activity that I enjoy – eating breakfast. As a result, I began taking my vitamins every morning. Re-designing my habits by pairing new habits with enjoyable, already established habits has improved my effectiveness, happiness, and health.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">The third law, make it easy, is about removing some of the steps it takes to perform a desirable behavior. This can be done by <i>priming your environment</i> – changing the way your space is organized to remove obstacles and make chosen behaviors more likely to occur. For example, since the pandemic began, I have been exercising at home instead of going to the gym. However, I have found it difficult to motivate myself to work out. Instead of slacking off and letting my health suffer, I chose to prime my environment instead. I took my weight set out of my closet and placed it in the center of my room to make it easily accessible. It now serves as a daily reminder to exercise, and my health has improved with the increased activity.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">Another technique for making it easy is the <i>two-minute rule</i>, where you commit to doing a new habit for two minutes every day. Only two minutes? Precisely. When trying to form a habit, consistency is key, and it is easier to stick to a small commitment than a large one. James Clear put it perfectly: “You have to standardize before you optimize.” Forcing myself to be consistent (even if I am only doing the activity for two minutes) has made my desired behaviors more likely to occur and thus improved my productivity, health, and happiness. </p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">The fourth law, make it satisfying, involves making your habits have a payoff. One technique Clear outlines is <i>immediate rewards</i> – giving yourself a reward as soon as you finish the desired behavior. A reward will make the behavior more enjoyable – and this makes it more likely you will repeat the desired behavior. For example, each evening before bed, I plan out my schedule for the next day. In the past, I used to structure a day full of work, asking myself to slave away with no compensation. I thought if I could only finish all my work in one day, I could take a couple of days off. When the next day came, instead of actually doing the rigorous schedule I set out for myself, I would usually fall apart after a couple of hours and waste the rest of the day playing video games. I was getting burned out because there was no incentive for me to follow my planned schedule. This cycle of creating a strict schedule and falling short persisted off and on until I read <i>Atomic Habits</i>. Since then, I changed how I plan my days, adding immediate rewards to my schedule. I started asking myself, “what does my ideal day look like?” I implemented more frequent breaks and made deals with myself – if I work on this project for an hour, I can take a 20-minute break and watch a YouTube video, or if I complete this one big task, I can stop working for the day and hang out virtually with friends. I made my routine satisfying by promising an immediate reward for good behavior, making it more likely that I will stay on task, complete my objectives, and avoid burnout. Thus, with these systems in place, my time is both productive and fulfilling.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">Using these four laws, I revolutionized my routine from top to bottom and improved my daily life. I am practicing healthy behaviors, staying on task, and getting things done more consistently – including enjoyable things I want to do. I would highly recommend grabbing a copy of <i>Atomic Habits</i>, so you, too, can revolutionize your routine and engineer the life you want. </p>\n\n<hr size=\"15\">\n<p class=\"bodytext\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http://img.faculty.unlv.edu/lab/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/J.D.-Author-Photo-DONE.jpg\" alt=\"jd\" width=\"232\" height=\"212\" align=\"left\" hspace=\"5\" vspace=\"1\">J.D.

I mentally begin organizing each aspect of my day between work, school, and hopefully a little downtime before bed. Throughout the day, my mind is continually fixating on any number of impending tasks, rather than focusing on what I am doing in the moment. While working in the morning, my mind is concentrating on an afternoon meeting. As that meeting begins, my mind is starting to draft the term paper I plan to write later. And when I finally sit down to type up that draft, my mind is attending to tomorrow, the upcoming weekend, next month, next…. well, you get the idea. It’s as though my mind is training for a triathlon, determined to beat me to some invisible finish line that keeps moving further down the road. And while I’m trailing behind, struggling to keep up, I miss so much of what is right in front of me. </p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">The future isn’t always a bad place to be. Our minds have to go there from time to time to prepare and set our sights on goals. But if we stay there for too long, perhaps trying to solve the problems that our minds create, we build up undue anxiety and waste time. It wasn’t until reading Eckhart Tolle’s <i>The Power of Now</i> that I finally learned some quick and effective ways to bring my mind back from the future and into the present. </p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">The methods taught by Tolle have the capability of bringing the mind into an almost meditative state, with the added benefit that they can be put into practice anytime and anywhere. One such method is to simply direct your attention into the present by concentrating on your senses. Focus deeply on the physical sensations you feel, the sounds you hear, and the images you see. As your attention becomes grounded in the senses, the mind’s needless noise begins to fade into the background, and what you are left with is an ineffable feeling of peace. </p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">Directing my attention into the present is a method I now strive to practice daily. Whenever I notice that my mind has traveled away from the present moment, I stop and bring awareness to my senses. I feel the carpet beneath my feet and the sensations in my fingertips as I type. I hear the birds chirping outside as I gaze at the trees through the window. I simply focus on everything that is happening right in front of me. Doing this relieves the underlying, ever-present stress that my mind engenders when it travels to the future – where it creates problems that don’t exist. </p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">There are still times when I ruminate on a specific stressor and find it challenging to direct my attention into the present. In these difficult moments, another technique Tolle calls “watching the thinker” pulls me out of the depths of my mind. This technique is different from directing your attention into the present via the senses because, instead of focusing on your external environment, you shift your attention inward. You must listen to the voice in your head and refrain from passing judgement. By separating yourself from your mind and its thoughts, you become an impartial observer and you begin to recognize that the story your mind is telling you is imaginary. According to Tolle, doing this activates a higher level of consciousness that can help carry you back into the present.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">For example, the other day I was considering whether I am ready to start applying for graduate school in the fall. My mind was running in circles, preoccupied with fears and anxieties, and I became overwhelmed. I attempted many times to direct my attention into the present but failed. Fortunately, I remembered the method of “watching the thinker.” I oriented my focus inward and, without judgement, began to listen to the voice in my head. I became aware not only of the rapid deluge of thoughts, but also of myself separate from those thoughts. This quickly dammed the flood and alleviated the disquietude that pervaded me. </p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">While it is necessary to allow the mind to peer down the road at times, the future is not where we should live. The time we spend there is inversely proportional to the amount of deep, enriching experiences we have in the present. Discovering Tolle’s practices has given me two quick and easy ways to stop the incessant running of my future-bound mind. If you find yourself stuck in the future or struggling to immerse yourself in the present, I highly recommend picking up a copy of Tolle’s book and experiencing <i>The Power of Now</i> for yourself. </p>\n\n<hr size=\"15\">\n<p class=\"bodytext\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http://img.faculty.unlv.edu/lab/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Cassandra-author-photo.jpg\" alt=\"cassandra\" width=\"219\" height=\"232\" align=\"left\" hspace=\"5\" vspace=\"1\">Cassandra Hoffman has been a member of the Interactive Measurement Group since fall of 2020.

Society proclaims fame, fortune, success, and status as the main sources of joy. Because of this, people’s lives revolve around goals that will bring those things to fruition. We can easily fall prey to the misconception that joy only comes from grandiose achievements, but in <i>Short Cuts to Happiness</i>, Ben-Shahar shares the key to meaningful and lasting joy. By shifting your focus to the people that matter most to you and by being present, you can enjoy each moment of your life. The ideas I learned from this book have become constant reminders that the happiness I seek is all around me. </p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">In <i>Short Cuts to Happiness</i>, Ben-Shahar writes about how people, including himself, go through a period in their lives where they feel empty and unfulfilled. To remedy those feelings, they look to what society claims would propel them to new heights. In doing so, they allow other people to dictate what would bring them joy. However, Ben-Shahar learned that, to experience joy, a person does not need an external change, but rather an internal one – one that opens their eyes to the happiness that is all around them. </p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">After reading Ben-Shahar’s book, I thought about my life and how I too might have been mistaken about the true source of happiness. I was surrounded by some of the most talented and successful hospitality professionals. Because I looked up to them, I adopted similar habits of dedicating all my energy to work, intentionally reaching for similar successes. At first, my efforts were recognized, and this led to opportunities that I could never have imagined. I thought I was happy; however, as time passed, the very things that previously brightened my day (e.g., meeting powerful and famous people and attending fancy galas) seemed to lose their effect. Over time, I came to understand that these external rewards were not the true happiness I sought and that these experiences, rooted in pleasure, only temporarily filled my needs. I began to ask myself: what was I doing wrong, and what did I need to change to attain sustainable happiness? </p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">Determined to find answers, I decided to reflect on the things that I thought would lead to happiness and explore different ways that would help me realize my goal. In the past, I pursued happiness by focusing on achieving career success. As a result, the time I spent with family and friends dwindled. However, Ben-Shahar believed the key to happiness is putting effort into nurturing successful relationships instead of pursuing a successful career. I considered his advice and took advantage of any opportunity to spend more time with my family and friends. I participated in the little things, such as accompanying my sister on dog walks, helping my niece do her hair, going on random hikes with friends, and attending impromptu dinners with family and friends. When I prioritized the most important people in my life, a feeling of warmth spread through me; I began to smile more just by being in their presence. All I had to do was shift my focus to the people who mattered most to me. </p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">Ben-Shahar mentions Western culture’s obsession with doing (i.e., goal striving) and how this obsession prevents people from enjoying the fruits of simply being alive. I was focusing so much on my future that I often missed out on the present and the opportunity to take in the beauty and happiness of life along the way. Because I did not want to miss out on any more of these precious moments, I decided to make some changes. I made a conscious effort to remove a huge distraction when I was not in the office – my work electronics. I told myself it was okay if I didn’t respond to emails immediately. When I slowed down and took a break from constantly being on the go, my anxiety levels gradually declined. I found myself appreciating more breathtaking sunsets and enjoying the sounds of birds chirping outside my bedroom window. My deliberate effort to slow down and focus on the present allowed me to experience life in a more meaningful way, embracing and enjoying every little detail as it occurred. </p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">In my quest to find happiness, I discovered that the real source came from shifting my focus to the people I love and living in the moment to appreciate the small things in life. To be happy I didn’t need to achieve success or a certain status. True joy already existed in my life; all I needed to do was look around. </p>\n\n\n<hr size=\"15\">\n<p class=\"bodytext\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http://img.faculty.unlv.edu/lab/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Jerlyn-cropped.jpg\" alt=\"jerlyn\" width=\"171\" height=\"232\" align=\"left\" hspace=\"5\" vspace=\"1\">Jerlyn Malasig joined the Interactive Measurement Group in Fall 2020.

Yes, I thought a plant or two would look cool in my apartment, but having plants would mean yet more responsibilities. After debating about it with myself for over a year, I decided to just go for it. On my birthday, I bought eight new plants and set them up in front of my balcony. While I didn’t know it in that moment, it soon became apparent that caring for my plants would become an invaluable way of caring for myself. The plant responsibilities I’d long avoided help me stay positive, embrace a deeper connection to nature, and slow down. </p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">When COVID-19 struck and I was quarantined in my tiny apartment all day, every day, I was extremely grateful to have my plants nearby. Instead of ending my days on an anxious note, dwelling on thoughts of my impending tasks, I spent time tending to my plants. I misted them, I dusted off their big glossy leaves, I stuck my fingers into the soil to sense how much water they needed, I checked the stems and leaves for pests, and I repotted them as they continued to grow. The vines I saw sprout when I first bought my plants – those vines now almost reach the floor. Despite the fear, uncertainty, and stress in the world, this evidence of life and growth gives me something to look forward to. Indeed, my plants have helped me maintain an optimistic outlook. </p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">Additionally, my plants bring some of the outdoors inside, which reminds me to go outside more often. Shortly after buying my plants, I started taking daily walks around my neighborhood. I now notice and have a greater appreciation for the natural life surrounding me. I see the plants blooming in the spring, I notice the birds flitting in and out of trees, and I even witnessed a hummingbird raise two of its babies. These experiences have made me feel more connected to nature than I have in a long time. </p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">Lastly, caring for my plants forces me to slow down and focus on what is happening right in front of me. If I don’t take time to appreciate the present moment, how else will I see a new leaf unfurling on my <a href=\"https://www.thespruce.com/grow-monstera-adansonii-swiss-cheese-plant-1902774\" style=\"color: #b10202 !important; text-decoration: underline !important;\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><font\nstyle=\" color:#b10202;\">Monstera adansonii</font></a>? How else will I notice the teeny green upshoots at the base of my <a href=\"https://www.thespruce.com/peperomia-plant-4584414\" style=\"color: #b10202 !important; text-decoration: underline !important;\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><font\nstyle=\" color:#b10202;\">peperomia</font></a>? Through the process of caring for my plants, I have been able to appreciate these simple things. </p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">My plant care activities help my plants thrive and grow, but they’re also therapeutic for me. They help me stay positive, be more mindful of the natural world around me, and remind me to slow down and appreciate the simple things. For a long time, I resisted owning plants because I thought they’d take away from the bit of free time I had, but in reality, caring for plants has given me much more than I ever expected. If you’ve mulled over a plant purchase, I can attest that plant care is well worth the effort, and you, too, will see that the plant is not the only thing that will flourish. </p>\n\n<hr size=\"15\">\n<p class=\"bodytext\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http://img.faculty.unlv.edu/lab/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Lindsay-author-photo-DONE.jpeg\" alt=\"lindsay\" width=\"179\" height=\"232\" align=\"left\" hspace=\"5\" vspace=\"5\">Lindsay Denecker was an active member of the Interactive Measurement Group from Spring 2019 through Summer 2020.

Consequently, his efforts earned him a coveted spot in the Counseling Psychology PhD program at Texas Tech!</p>\n<p class=\"body\">Bryce joined the Interactive Measurement Group in the spring of 2019. During his time in our lab, he gained valuable research experience and fulfilled many leadership roles. He co-authored four research posters, which he presented at six conferences, including the American Association for Behavioral Sciences, the Rocky Mountain Psychological Association, and the Western Psychological Association. He also led several workshops and took on leadership roles, such as Poster Leader, Conference Coordinator, and Interactive Mentoring Program Coordinator.</p>\n<p class=\"body\">Outside of the Interactive Measurement Group, Bryce worked with Dr. Shane Kraus as a research assistant for the Behavioral Addictions Lab. In this lab, he conducted research on the associations between PTSD and mental health correlates in a national survey of U.S. veterans. He is listed as first author on this research and plans to submit the manuscript for publication. As the son of a U.S. veteran, he seeks to have a positive impact on the lives of those who serve in our military. This desire underpins his overarching research goals aimed at informing policy decisions, resource allocation, screening, and treatment efforts for U.S. veterans.</p>\n<p class=\"body\">In addition to Bryce’s research accomplishments, he also completed an internship at a clinical private practice and joined many professional organizations. During his internship, he performed administrative tasks, observed clinical diagnostic intakes and client assessments, and learned how to score and interpret the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory. Bryce was also an active member of UNLV’s McNair Scholars Institute, the UNLV Outreach Undergraduate Mentorship Program, UNLV’s Psychology Club, and the Nevada Psychological Association.</p>\n<p class=\"body\">In the spring of 2021, Bryce graduated with his bachelor’s degree in Psychology and minor in Sociology.  Bryce’s strong work ethic and unwavering determination earned him the Outstanding Psychology Senior Award from the Department of Psychology and the Shining Star Award from the Outreach Undergraduate Mentoring Program.</p>\n<p class=\"body\">This fall, Bryce will be attending Texas Tech’s Counseling Psychology Ph.D. Program. At Texas Tech, he plans to work on advancing evidence-based assessment and understanding barriers to engagement and retention in mental health services – focusing on military and trauma-exposed populations.</p>\n<p class=\"body\">We look forward to seeing his future accomplishments. Congratulations, Bryce!</p>\n<hr size=\"15\">\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n",

Bryce has also co-authored a poster on the topic of uncovering the factors that underlie the Perceived Social Intelligence Scales, which was presented at the American Association for Behavioral and Social Science conference 2020.</p>\n<p class=\"body\">After my acceptance into the McNair Scholars Institute in the spring of 2020, I sought to build upon my research skills through the McNair Scholars Summer Research Institute. During the summer of 2020, I worked with Dr. Shane Kraus, who runs the Behavioral Addictions Lab. Through our collaboration, I became an author of a manuscript that examines the associations between post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and mental health in a national survey of U.S. veterans. In this manuscript, I sought to understand the demographic and clinical characteristics of U.S. veterans who endorse symptoms of PTSD. I also sought to inform resource allocation and policy decisions that can help veterans obtain quality mental health services.</p>\n<p class=\"body\">Through my McNair research, I discovered that the perceived stigma of seeking mental health counselling contributed, albeit weakly, to the prediction of probable PTSD, after adjusting for demographic, military, and mental health factors. Our finding suggests that perceived stigma could help identify veterans with probable PTSD. Further work is needed to help veterans combat stigma through community-based efforts such as mental health outreach in the veteran community.</p>\n<p class=\"body\">I thoroughly enjoyed being a part of the McNair Scholars Summer Research Institute because it helped me grow as a researcher. As a result of this research, I learned to use new measures, such as the Primary Care PTSD Screen for DSM-5; I became proficient in various statistics, such as chi-square and logistic regression; and I developed strong communication and time management skills. I also collaborated with researchers at Yale University and now plan to submit my research to an academic journal. I hope to use my experience in the McNair Scholars Institute to continue my research on the veteran population in graduate school.</p>\n<hr size=\"15\">\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n",

These three words are often repeated to American children in hopes of spreading awareness on the importance of recycling. Yet how many of us have eaten boxed meals and drank canned beverages and then proceeded to actually throw it all into the recycling bin? Unlike some countries, the United States does not have a strict recycling system in place and recycling contamination has become a huge issue. When I first went back to Japan as an adult, I was in for a rude awakening. </p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">When I first stepped off the plane in Japan, it was hard to find garbage bins, but when I did, I noticed that there were different categories of bins. Each bin was shaped differently so as to remind you that only certain products can go in it. When I met up with my mother and wanted to help around the home, I had to get used to seeing four different trash cans. </p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">Adapting to this system became even trickier when I started studying abroad and had no one to essentially “teach me” what was recyclable or not in Japan. When the dorm managers gave me four well-labelled trash cans, I knew I had to sit down and truly learn how to recycle properly. If I did not learn how to properly recycle in Japan, I would incur the wrath of the dorm managers. Their anger would be valid, as the garbage collectors refuse to pick up trash if they see anything thrown away incorrectly. </p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">Learning how to effectively prepare and categorize my waste was no easy task. It was honestly a pain to have to wash everything before I threw it away. However, the more I learned and practiced how to categorize my waste, the easier it became. It was something that became natural over time. </p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">Japan’s strict guidelines for garbage sorting help reduce recycling contamination. In the United States, the loose recycling guidelines have led to about 25 percent of the stuff we try to recycle to be too contaminated to go anywhere but the landfill. After visiting Japan, I have made a point of learning how to reduce recycling contamination here in the United States. Below are nine pieces of advice that you can implement into your recycling habits in order to help reduce recycling contamination. </p>\n\n<p class=\"body\"> <b> How to Prevent Recycling Contamination </b> </p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">1. Rinse your jars, glasses, and recyclable food containers to get rid of food waste, grease, oil, etc.   To be recycled, containers must be <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&#038;v=e28e6gwtoO4&#038;feature=youtu.be\" style=\"color: #b10202 !important; text-decoration: underline !important;\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><font\nstyle=\" color:#b10202;\">empty, clean, and dry</font></a>.  Put your recycling to the “smell test”.  If it smells of food, it probably has food or liquid waste in it. </p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">2. Never recycle <a href=\"https://recyclingsimplified.com/tip/rule-of-thumb/\"style=\"color: #b10202 !important; text-decoration: underline !important;\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><font\nstyle=\" color:#b10202;\">anything smaller than a credit card</font></a>.  Small objects are too small to be captured by the recycling machines and so they end up in the landfill. Before they get there, though, they are likely to jam the recycling machines. </p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">3. Leave the lids on plastic bottles.  In Japan, we had to take the lids off of plastic containers. They used to ask people to do this in the United States, too, <a href=\"https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/575847/leave-cap-on-plastic-bottle-before-recycling\" style=\"color: #b10202 !important; text-decoration: underline !important;\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><font\nstyle=\" color:#b10202;\">but now they ask us to leave the lids on</font></a>.  Modern recycling machines can automatically sort the lids out from the containers.  If we take them off, those little lids tend to get sorted into landfill-bound waste.  Moreover, if we separate the lids from the bottles, the bottles might end up crushed flat.  When that happens, they can be mistaken for paper, contaminating the paper supply.  That’s why we shouldn’t crush plastic bottles, either. </p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">4. Even though bottle caps are small, <a href=\"https://recyclecoach.com/residents/blog/can-you-recycle-metal-bottle-caps/\" style=\"color: #b10202 !important; text-decoration: underline !important;\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><font\nstyle=\" color:#b10202;\">it’s still possible to recycle them</font></a>.  First, check each lid to see if the cap is steel or aluminum (if it’s steel, it will stick to a magnet).  Then put your steel lids in a steel can and put your aluminum lids in an aluminum can.  When the cans are half-full, crimp the cans closed so the lids can’t fall out and put the closed cans in your recycling bin.  If you can’t sort and seal the bottle caps, throw them in the trash instead. </p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">5. Some plastics can be recycled.  Plastics are labelled #1 through #7.  In Clark Country, Republic Services accepts plastic <a href=\"https://www.republicservices.com/recycling-guide?tab=local\" style=\"color: #b10202 !important; text-decoration: underline !important;\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><font\nstyle=\" color:#b10202;\">containers</font></a> labelled #1 through #7.  This includes soda bottles, water bottles, cooking oil containers, shampoo bottles, yogurt tubs, and milk jugs (but not milk cartons). <b>  However, Clark County does not accept plastic bags, bubble wrap, plastic wrap, Styrofoam, plastic furniture, or toys. </b> In fact, plastic bags are the <a href=\"https://www.rubicon.com/blog/recycling-contamination/\" style=\"color: #b10202 !important; text-decoration: underline !important;\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><font\nstyle=\" color:#b10202;\">number one recycling contaminant</font></a> and often clog recycling machines.  If you can poke your finger through the plastic, it doesn’t belong in your recycling bin.  Instead, take them to your local grocery store. </p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">If you are outside Clark County, keep in mind that some recycling programs accept plastics, but the final decision is made at the sorting facility. <a href=\"https://www.rubicon.com/blog/how-to-recycle-plastics/\" style=\"color: #b10202 !important; text-decoration: underline !important;\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><font style=\" color:#b10202;\">The most commonly recycled plastics are #1 PET and #2 HDPE. Plastics #3 through #7 are sometimes recyclable</font></a>. Check with your local recycling facility. </p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">6. <a href=\"https://recyclingsimplified.com/tip/dont-mix-it-up/\" style=\"color: #b10202 !important; text-decoration: underline !important;\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><font\nstyle=\" color:#b10202;\">Don’t mix it up</font></a>. If a product contains two recyclable materials (like a paper label inside a plastic container), you need to remove the label and recycle both items individually.  If a product contains a recyclable material along with a non-recyclable material, you need to separate them. For example, for a window envelope, you need to remove the plastic window and throw it away before recycling the paper. </p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">7. For that same reason, cardboard boxes can be recycled, but <a href=\"https://mashable.com/article/how-to-recycle-amazon-packaging/\" style=\"color: #b10202 !important; text-decoration: underline !important;\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><font\nstyle=\" color:#b10202;\">the tape should be removed</font></a> before you put it in the bin. </p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">8. On the other hand, it’s okay to leave the paper labels on cans.  The recycling process involves a step where the labels and excess glue are burned away.  However, if the label itself is recyclable paper, then <a href=\"https://residentialwastesystems.com/blog/should-i-remove-labels-before-recycling-cans-and-bottles/#:~:text=It%20is%20NOT%20mandatory%20for,excess%20glue%20are%20burned%20away.\" style=\"color: #b10202 !important; text-decoration: underline !important;\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><font\nstyle=\" color:#b10202;\">removing it will allow it to be recycled separately</font></a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">9. Finally, double check what you put in the bin.  The recycling label on the item will give you some idea about what is and is not recyclable.  However, you need to check online for your local guidelines, because what can be recycled depends upon the local recycling facility.  <a href=\"https://www.republicservices.com/recycling-guide?tab=local\" style=\"color: #b10202 !important; text-decoration: underline !important;\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><font\nstyle=\" color:#b10202;\">Republic Services’ Recycling Guide</font></a> provides Clark County residents guidelines for their recycling program, and you can enter your zip-code to confirm what is recyclable in other areas. </p>\n\n<p class=\"body\"> <center> Remember, check before you chuck! </center> </p>\n\n\n<hr size=\"15\">\n<p class=\"bodytext\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http://img.faculty.unlv.edu/lab/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG-0734-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"Aika\" width=\"175\" height=\"200\" align=\"left\" hspace=\"5\" vspace=\"5\">Aika Dietz was a member of the Interactive Measurement Group from spring of 2018 to fall of 2020.

Larry King’s and Bill Gilbert’s book, How to Talk to Anyone, Anytime, Anywhere, helped me get my foot in the proverbial door. This book taught me what I thought I knew all my life: talking, unlike breathing, is a skill that needs to be maintained and much like other skills, there are tips and tricks to help enhance it. </p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">To become an effective talker, I had to overcome my biggest obstacle: my shyness. I used to be afraid of being judged for breaking the silence. Worse, I was petrified of the possible awkwardness that might follow if my attempt to start a conversation failed. For example, in my second year of college, one of my classmates struck up some small talk with me on the first day of class. However, each day after that, I couldn’t bear the thought of starting up another conversation. As a result, we didn’t talk for the rest of the semester and it was awkward. Experiences like that left a huge impact on me; I realized that I can’t keep waiting for people to break the ice, I have to learn how to break it myself. </p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">While reading King’s book, I found that we all experience anxiety when talking to a stranger. This helped me realize that we are all afraid of getting rejected and embarrassed. All of these fears lead us to avoid starting a conversation. To help get over the anxiety of initiating a conversation, King suggests we figure out the other person’s interests. People love talking about what they love, whether it be about their hobbies, pets, or musical tastes. Finding out those interests can help shatter any nervousness between people initiating a conversation. Knowing that all of us are the same in that way makes breaking the ice an easier task. The following semester proved more fruitful. As I put King’s advice to the test, I was rewarded with a nice acquaintanceship with some of the students and professors in each of my classes, some of which I’m still in contact with. </p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">Being a good listener is another simple and effective way of having a great conversation. Your conversation partner will be more motivated and comfortable talking if they see you are listening attentively to what they have to say. It is important to know that talking is a two-way street &#8212; not a one-way road – and only talking about yourself is rude and improper. I used to be self-absorbed in conversations, only wishing to talk about what was on my mind. Such was the case in my first semester of college when I went to a professor’s office hours for the first time. I spoke about my problems, yet didn’t listen to any of the solutions he gave me.  Looking back, it was quite an awkward meeting, so I sought to improve this weakness. The next semester, with this experience still fresh in my mind, I took the first opportunity to go to a professor’s office hours to discuss study habits. Forcing myself to listen more and to talk about myself less improved the quality of the office hours dramatically, leaving me in high spirits. </p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">I know firsthand how difficult it can be to start and keep a conversation. I was homeschooled for all of middle school and over a year of high school, so I had less opportunities to develop the social skills many adolescents do. King&#8217;s book was a great crash course for the techniques of conversation that I have missed. I have managed to improve my conversation skills through hard work, courage, and practicing King’s advice. I highly recommend this book to anyone who has had experiences similar to mine; this book has helped me come out of my shell and given me the essential tools to practice the skill of conversation. </p>\n\n<hr size=\"15\">\n<p class=\"bodytext\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http://img.faculty.unlv.edu/lab/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Filip-author-photo-DONE.jpg\" alt=\"J.D.\" width=\"250\" height=\"230\" align=\"left\" hspace=\"5\" vspace=\"5\">Filip Bjelica joined the Interactive Measurement Group in the fall of 2019.

This fall, Monica led a poster team that conducted research on censored data. Monica is also an active board member of Kappa Delta Chi Sorority, Inc. on campus, serving as Philanthropy Chair. This fall, Monica helped to virtually organize and host Kappa Delta Chi’s 11th annual conference, Growing Latinas into Outstanding Women (G.L.O.W.)!</p>\n<p class=\"body\">G.L.O.W. is a free all-day event hosted for all high school girls in the Clark County School District. This event is an opportunity for high school girls to learn more about higher education and to build on leadership skills. Ultimately, the main goal of this event is to leave these girls inspired and empowered to do good for themselves and their community.</p>\n<p class=\"bodytext\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http://img.faculty.unlv.edu/lab/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Monica-New-Member-photo-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"Fits\" width=\"194\" height=\"232\" align=\"left\" hspace=\"5\" vspace=\"3\">Monica played a vital role in the organization of this event. She organized the itinerary and important forms, kept in contact with prospective participants, helped organize two panels, and reached out to community leaders to present workshops. Additionally, for the first time, Monica’s sorority was able to award two scholarships valued at $300 to two of the high school senior participants.

These pre-recorded presentations, along with their associated posters, became accessible at the beginning of the convention on October 28.  When attendees read the posters and viewed the presentations, they were able to leave questions and comments on the associated discussion thread for the poster.   Additionally, presenters were assigned a time slot when they were expected to be online to answer questions live.  Sometimes attendees and presenters were able to have written live exchanges.   Attendees could also email presenters by clicking on the authors’ name.</p>\n<p class=\"body\">WPA attendees also benefited from statistics workshops, invited presentations, symposia, and social activities.

To join our lab, you only need to commit to 1 semester.  Create a plan that fits your needs and your schedule.</li><li>The videos mention several ways of evening out the workload across semesters.  One method they omit is to spread out your studying for the GRE.  For example, you could plan to do most of your GRE studying next summer, but spend 2 hours per week on your vocabulary between now and then.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m hoping you can watch the videos, create your schedule as an Excel file or GoogleSheet, and then send your planned schedule to our lab manager.

From the base of the mountain, I scan up to the top. The peak is quite far; it will take many steps to get there. At the start of the hike, when my motivation is strongest, this distance does not seem daunting. Step by step, one after the other, I make my way towards the summit. After a while, I begin to tire. I can feel it in my legs, my feet, my back, and my chest. I am breathing deeply and starting to sweat. With the desert sun beating down, the day is warmer than I expected. I pause to take a drink of water and pour some on my face. Looking up once more, the summit is still far off. In fact, it appears further away than it did when I started. Yikes! I wonder if it is time to give up and go back. After all, there is air conditioning in the car and I am getting hungry and there is pizza at home and – </p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">Whenever I hike, these rationalizations arise when I begin to fatigue and it seems I am getting no closer to my goal.  Nevertheless, these thoughts dissipate when I turn back to look down the already trodden path and recognize all the progress I have made. When I am moving towards my goal, I only notice each step, each tiny bit of progress. I feel the soreness and exhaustion overpowering my motivation. Looking forward to the top of the mountain reminds me of how far I have to go; this can be daunting and disheartening. On the other hand, looking back helps me measure my progress. Even though I am sore and tired, surveying the gorgeous landscape and seeing the path winding down the mountain renews my motivation to keep striving for the top. </p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">I noticed a similar situation with journaling. I enjoy writing; I often journal to keep track of my life, to mark my accomplishments and my failures as time marches on. When pursuing my life’s various goals, whether oriented towards my career, my relationships, or my personal aspirations, journaling is one way I keep track of my progress. I recently discovered some of my old journals hidden away in a dusty box. I was pleasantly surprised to see how many things I have improved on over the years. Looking at old journals, I am reminded of how far I have come and the things I have accomplished on the way to reaching my aspirations. One example of this is physical exercise. For many years I have wanted to sustain a workout routine. Currently, I have reached this goal: I now exercise every day. Reading through old journals allows me to recognize past goals – such as daily exercise – which I have realized in the present. This recognition motivates me to keep striving to reach other goals; it is a testament to the progress I have already made in other areas of my life. </p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">Journaling and hiking have this measure of progress in common. When I am busy with schoolwork and lab activities, I measure myself by how far I am from my current goals. This is like looking at the summit while hiking a mountain: the goal seems far off and difficult to reach. Both of these viewpoints neglect past triumphs that led me to my present place. Reorienting myself towards past achievements takes my mind off the present obstacle and helps me acknowledge positive change over time. Measuring this progress motivates me and gives me the push I need to keep striving for my goals. </p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">When striving for your goals in life, take time to pause and reflect on all the progress you have made; this will help you renew your motivation and recognize how far you have come. It is easy to lose sight of what you have achieved when you focus on the goal – or summit – too much. Whether you are looking back down the recently trodden trail, reading through old journal entries, or measuring achievements in your own way, do not forget to acknowledge your advancements. Recognizing your progress will motivate you to reach new heights of excellence. Look back so you can move forward. </p>\n\n<hr size=\"15\">\n<p class=\"bodytext\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http://img.faculty.unlv.edu/lab/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/J.D.-Author-Photo-DONE.jpg\" alt=\"J.D.\" width=\"254\" height=\"232\" align=\"left\" hspace=\"5\" vspace=\"5\">J.D.

I thought I would have to wait until the fall to present my research poster. However, a unique opportunity presented itself that semester: UNLV’s Office of Undergraduate Research (OUR) held its first virtual research symposium. I was ecstatic that I wouldn’t have to wait until October to share the work we did in the Interactive Measurement Group. </p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">My poster teammates, Matthew Helm and Lindsay Denecker, and I eagerly submitted our abstract to the symposium and waited anxiously for an email from OUR. I was delighted when we got accepted to present. However, we weren’t quite prepared for a virtual presentation. Moreover, we couldn’t work together in person as the university was closed and we were practicing social distancing.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">The necessary materials we needed to submit to the symposium included a PDF of our poster (piece of cake, we made this months ago) and a 6-minute YouTube video presentation. That would require more time, effort, and excellent communication between my poster team and I. How would we record our presentation? Who would write the script? Who would do the voiceover? These were just some of the questions we asked ourselves. </p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">We only had a week to coordinate and execute our presentation, so we needed to answer our own questions quickly. We would record our presentation in Microsoft PowerPoint using a slideshow we made during our lab meetings in 2019. The script would be adapted from the research paper we spent a whole semester writing. We would all contribute to the voiceover, alternating our voices between slides. We had our PowerPoint slides and script ready, it was time to tackle the voice recordings.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"body\">Recording voice overs presented challenges I wasn’t expecting. It was difficult to remain within the time limit; I had to determine which parts of our research to exclude. It was time consuming; I had to rerecord my slides many times due to background noises or mistakes in my narration.  My teammates experienced those struggles as well. After multiple rounds of sending the slides back and forth to Matthew and Lindsay, we reached our goal: a 6-minute-long presentation with clear recordings. Matthew converted the slides into a YouTube video and submitted our final materials with some time to spare. </p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">Our work was up for display and open to comments for a week on OUR’s website.  Somebody commented on our presentation asking us several questions about our research, which made the experience more interactive. The cherry on the top came at the end of the week when we were awarded with Best Poster Presentation in Arts, Humanities, &#038; Social Sciences.  All of our hard work paid off at the end. You can still find our virtual presentation. <a></a><a href=\"http://oursymposium.sites.unlv.edu/v2/program/what-the-factors-perceptions-of-social-intelligence-in-robots/\">here.</a></p>\n\n<p class=\"body\"> I highly recommend presenting your projects at virtual events if you get the chance. The experience will challenge you to adapt to a new format of conferences and allow you to share your work at a safe distance while still being able to interact with others. </p>\n\n<hr size=\"15\">\n\n<p class=\"bodytext\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http://img.faculty.unlv.edu/lab/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Jelsy-Lab-Picture-2in-x-3.5in-DONE-e1588127045907.jpg\" alt=\"Jelsy\" width=\"194\" height=\"278\" align=\"left\" hspace=\"5\" vspace=\"5\">Jelsy has been a member of the Interactive Measurement Group since Fall 2018.

We are delighted to announce that he has been accepted into the Clinical Psychology Ph.D. program here at UNLV! Ray served in the U.S. Navy for nine years and was a police officer for another six.  Those 15 years taught Ray that there is an epidemic of PTSD in both communities, and he resolved to help.  He therefore dedicated himself to becoming a clinical psychologist.  He enrolled at UNLV and joined our lab. After a year with us, he joined a clinical research lab with Dr. Donohue, began a clinical internship at UNLV’s The <a href=\"https://www.unlv.edu/thepractice\">PRACTICE</a>, and collaborated with Dr. Klaus on another clinical project.  Ray graduated in Spring 2020 with his B.A. in Psychology and minor in Family Studies, and he is now going immediately into his PhD program. His determination and dedication have paid off.

My research and leadership tasks have changed every semester.  In summer 2018, I became an action editor (for this very newsletter), and in fall 2018 I become a teaching assistant for Kim Barchard’s introductory statistics course. The following spring, I chaired the weekly new member training meetings and simultaneously completed two research posters while working as an action editor. I also taught myself (and other lab members) how to use R to conduct statistical analyses and began training to become the next lab manager.  In summer 2019, I taught fellow lab members how to conduct an exploratory factor analysis in R and became the Public Relations Coordinator for the UNLV chapter of Psi Chi, the International Honor Society in Psychology. That fall, I taught lab members how to conduct a between-within ANOVA; co-authored another poster; and helped to organize, host, and recruit speakers for Psi Chi and Psychology club events.  Finally, this semester, because of the COVID-19 pandemic and UNLV’s shift to remote instruction, I converted our lab meetings into an online format so that we could continue to do research. I also served a critical function in organizing and hosting the first online event for UNLV’s chapter of Psi Chi. I was well prepared for that challenging task because of my experience with online teaching, both as a TA and in running online lab meetings.  Finally, I taught myself (and other lab members) how to use Jamovi to conduct statistical analyses.</p>\n<p class=\"body\">During my time at UNLV, I have accomplished a lot. More than I ever thought I would. I am looking forward to graduating this semester.  However, that doesn’t mean I’m done. After graduating, I plan to take the GRE and continue working on my graduate school applications. It is my goal to get accepted into a PhD program with an emphasis in cognitive, social, or educational experimental psychology. I will, after all, need a PhD to complete my ultimate aspiration to become a collegiate educator. I am also looking forward to (finally) presenting research at the 100th Western Psychological Association annual conference in October 2020. Hopefully, I’ll see you there!</p>\n<p class=\"body\">&nbsp;</p>\n<hr size=\"15\">\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n",

Whenever we touch a contaminated surface and then touch our faces, we risk becoming infected.  However, face touching is a common behavior that is rewarded every time we relieve discomfort by scratching an itchy nose or brushing a hair out of our eyes, and so for many of us it is an automatic habit.  I noticed that no one was explaining how to reduce or eliminate this hard-to-change behavior.  Therefore, I recruited two other UNLV professors to help me write an article explaining how to reduce face touching.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">Brian Labus is a professor of public health, who was able to explain what behaviors people should be avoiding.  For example, people should definitely avoid touching their eyes, nose, and mouth, but they should also avoid touching their glasses and hair.  Stephen Benning is a professor in clinical psychology, who teaches people how to use habit reversal therapy to eliminate damaging habits like nail biting, skin picking, and hair pulling.  Stephen and I combed the research literature to determine which habit reversal methods work best and which ones would likely work in the self-help context of an online article where readers do not work one-on-one with a personal therapist to help them eliminate a behavior.  With the help of many lab members who provided feedback on early drafts of the article, we three were able to write a short explanation of how to stop touching your face, by applying the principles of habit reversal therapy to the context of face touching.  Here you can read the original article in <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/how-to-stop-touching-your-face-to-minimize-spread-of-coronavirus-and-other-germs-133683\">English</a>, as well as translations in <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/coronavirus-il-faut-cesser-de-se-toucher-le-visage-oui-mais-comment-134177\">French</a>, <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/como-dejar-de-tocarse-la-cara-para-minimizar-la-propagacion-del-coronavirus-y-otros-germenes-134367\">Spanish</a>, and <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/berhenti-menyentuh-wajah-itu-susah-bagaimana-caranya-agar-tidak-terkena-wabah-covid-19-134400\">Indonesian</a>.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">As I wrote the article, I implemented many of my own suggestions.  I pulled my hair back and put ear hooks on my glasses.  I trimmed my nails and put a nail file by my desk.  I used sushi tongs to eat potato chips and a spoon to eat chocolate.  With all these situation modifications, I touched my face just three times per day.  I was proud of myself.  Then I got bored.  When a hair got in my eye, I moaned in frustration.  When I got pudding on my finger, I absentmindedly licked it off.  My motivation had waned.  However, I realized it will be months before we can go out in public without worrying that surfaces may be contaminated.  Therefore, I buckled down to work and formally recorded each time I touched my face – something I never did while writing the article, even though research shows written records are more effective.  Now I’m back to about three face-touches per day.  Some days I slip up, but if I keep following the best advice about how to reduce face-touching, I know I’ll reduce the chances of infection.</p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">I hope this article helps you reduce face touching, particularly when you are in public settings where you do not know if surfaces have been contaminated.  Feel free to share <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/how-to-stop-touching-your-face-to-minimize-spread-of-coronavirus-and-other-germs-133683\">our article</a> with anyone you think might benefit from reading it.</p>\n\n<hr size=\"15\">\n<p class=\"bodytext\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http://img.faculty.unlv.edu/lab/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Barchard-2014-crop-DONE.jpg\" alt=\"Kimberly Barchard\" width=\"226\" height=\"232\" align=\"left\" hspace=\"5\" vspace=\"5\">Kimberly A.

The nervous silence of the crowd broke when a woman off to my side said, “Ladies, if we can survive childbirth, we can survive this!”</p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">Laughter sounded all around me and then the burst of gunfire signaled the start of the race. The limbs of the women churned the already murky water. I panicked and flailed my arms and legs in what should have been a swim. Within minutes a reverberating thought overwhelmed me: “I hate this.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">The crowd swam ahead of me as I choked and struggled to breathe. A race volunteer in a kayak pulled up alongside me and asked if I wanted him to take me to shore. </p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">I shook my head. He asked every several minutes. The answer was always no.</p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">My heart sank when I realized I was the last one out of the water&#8211;by a long shot. Hours later, I stumbled toward the finish line, unable to find it because the race director had already taken it down.</p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">It was my first sprint distance triathlon (a 500 meter swim followed by a 12 mile bike ride and a 3.1 mile run) and I finished with the distinction known in the triathlon community as DFL (Dead F&#8212;ing Last). It would be years before I attempted another race. </p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">However, I’m glad I persevered and returned to racing. Not only did I prove to myself I could overcome the embarrassment of my first sad triathlon experience, I also learned important life lessons along the way. </p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">Here are the lessons I learned that you can apply to your life, even if you never swim, bike, and run in a triathlon:</p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">1.  Let yourself be a beginner</p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">Prior to my first triathlon, I had never swum in open water before. When I re-committed to triathlon training, I knew I’d have to overcome my fear of swimming in open water, so I signed up for several open water swim workshops. I hated them until my fifth swim when, as if a switch flipped, I became more comfortable despite the lower visibility, choppy waves, and different sighting patterns of the open water. Later, to my surprise, I grew to love my swims at the lake. </p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">I’ve since learned that a lot of things in life can be that way. Having the patience and self-compassion to allow yourself to be a beginner can open the door for new experiences you might not have if you give up.  You’ll make mistakes at first, but these are the best ways to learn how to improve the experience next time. Don’t beat yourself up for these mistakes. It’s your first time! Forgive yourself and keep going.</p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">If something is important to you, it’s worth more than one try. You might surprise yourself about what you can grow to enjoy.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">2.  Find your team</p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">Another mistake I made when training for my first race is that I did all my training and preparation alone. The second time around, I joined a local triathlon team. I met people of all ages and different levels of tri experience. Everyone was welcoming and encouraging. </p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">Not only did I now have a scheduled plan and people to get ideas and inspiration from, but I also had a built-in support network that made the long hours of training a lot more fun. I met one of my best friends through the tri team and we’re still supporting each other, only now in non-race-related goals. </p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">Having a support network of people with similar goals can give you the motivation to keep going. Your team members—whether they’re study partners, classmates, or friends—have perspectives and ideas that can help you. Whenever possible, don’t go it alone.</p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">3.  Anticipate your obstacles</p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">So much can go wrong when you’re swimming, biking, and running. The last time you want something to go awry is on race day. In triathlon, one motto is “Nothing new on race day.” The more comfortable and practiced you are with the movements, equipment, and conditions, the more confident you’ll feel when the starting gun goes off. </p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">No matter what you’re doing, practice is essential. However, practice is no guarantee. A little defensive pessimism can go a long way to help you anticipate what might go wrong. For example, I learned to wear an extra swim cap to prevent my goggles from being kicked off my face during the swim portion of the race. I also learned basic bike maintenance, so I would know what to do if one of my tires went flat. </p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">Whatever your goal, it’s helpful to believe that you can reach it, while at the same time considering what difficulties might arise. What might derail you from your goal? How can you prepare for that possibility, so it doesn’t prevent you from crossing your “finish line”? I discovered that an effective way to anticipate and prepare for potential obstacles is to talk to other people who are more experienced in what you want to do. My triathlon teammates gave me great advice.</p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">4.  Sometimes you need to persevere despite pain </p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">Most triathletes will tell you that pain is inevitable. At some point, whether on the bike when your legs are screaming as you pedal up a steep hill, or on the run when your feet are blistered and sore, you may feel discomfort or pain.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">In the thick of the race, however, putting the pain in perspective allowed me to keep going. The aches my body felt were temporary. At times when I wanted to quit, I reminded myself of all my hard work, training, and the finish line that awaited me. I pushed through the pain. </p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">When you’re working toward a big or difficult goal, anticipate moments when you’ll feel uncomfortable. This is not the time to give up! Keep going. The satisfaction of achieving your goal can be one of the best feelings. You’ll prove to yourself that you can do it and then you’ll know you can.</p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">Even though I’m not participating in triathlons anymore, I still apply the lessons I learned during my tri days to the academic goals I set for myself now. I allow myself to be a beginner by approaching each class with curiosity and not getting discouraged if I don’t immediately “get” or enjoy what I’m learning. I persevere even through painful tasks and projects. I find my team by studying with friends, and I anticipate obstacles by focusing on the material I think will most likely trip me up on the test. I hope you find these lessons helpful and can use them to reach your goals, too.</p>\n\n<hr size=\"15\">\n<p class=\"bodytext\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http://img.faculty.unlv.edu/lab/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Lindsay-Denecker-bio-photo-cropped-DONE.jpg\" alt=\"Lindsay\" width=\"200\" height=\"216\" align=\"left\" hspace=\"5\" vspace=\"3\">Lindsay Denecker is studying psychology at UNLV in pursuit of her goal to be a lifelong learner.

Though it may seem like a strange skill to cultivate, lucid dreaming, or realizing you are dreaming while in a dream, can help you utilize some of this time without sacrificing your sleep quality. The ultimate guide to lucid dreaming is Dr. Stephen LaBerge and Howard Rheingold’s <i>Exploring the World of Lucid Dreaming</i>, which employs Dr. LaBerge’s extensive dream research to help individuals dream consciously. Lucid dreaming is hard; however, the book is packed with useful techniques and clear guidelines to help turn unconscious dreams into playgrounds and workspaces. Within a few months of reading the book, I learned the techniques to induce lucidity, began to explore my own dream worlds, and learned to control my dreams for leisure and productivity. </p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">Why would a person want to master lucid dreaming? <i>Exploring the World of Lucid Dreaming</i> gives several applications for harnessing this skill, many of which I have tried and found to benefit my life. Lucid dreams offer the perfect setting for wish fulfillment because dreaming offers a vivid 3D world where anything is possible. One of the first things I did when I induced a lucid dream was fly. I felt tremendous excitement soaring over the rooftops of my neighborhood. Moreover, lucid dreams offer excellent opportunities for skill rehearsal. I had an essay due in one of my classes, and during a lucid dream, I was able to brainstorm topic ideas. I even wrote an introductory paragraph for my essay while dreaming (most of which I used for the actual essay). Additionally, lucid dreams offer the opportunity to take control of nightmares and conquer your fears. Once, a monster was chasing me in a dream, and the environment was so strange I realized I was dreaming. As I turned around to face the monster, I reminded myself it was a dream. The monster transformed into a stuffed animal and fell limp on the floor. Ultimately, the possible applications for lucid dreaming are endless; Dr. LaBerge mentions that people use lucid dreaming to practice creativity, overcome fears, heal trauma, and even have transcendent spiritual experiences. </p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">Dr. LaBerge and Howard Rheingold outline a number of techniques to induce lucidity while dreaming, however, these will not be effective unless you can remember your dreams. If you do not remember your dreams, you cannot benefit from the techniques because upon waking you will forget any dreams you had during the night (lucid or otherwise). Therefore, the first step in learning to lucid dream is to increase the number of dreams you can recall each night. Dr. LaBerge recommends getting eight hours of sleep each night to increase dream recall. On top of the health benefits, the majority of our dreams occur in the last two hours of our sleep cycle; thus, you are more likely to remember your dreams if you get enough sleep. Besides getting enough sleep, maintaining a dream journal is the best way to increase dream recall. I use a simple composition notebook, where I write a brief summary of each dream. In the beginning, it helped to write down as much detail as I could remember immediately upon waking. While this can be time consuming, it is extremely effective if you have trouble remembering any dreams at all. Later, once you are recalling at least one dream each night, you can reduce the detail to a single sentence summarizing the dream. Even a few words can suffice once your dream recall becomes sufficiently advanced. </p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">Once you remember at least one vivid dream per night, you can begin to practice the techniques outlined in <i>Exploring the World of Lucid Dreaming</i>. The following techniques are used to induce lucidity: </p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">1) Critical State Testing: Throughout the day while awake, ask yourself “Am I dreaming?” and then perform an activity to test if you are dreaming. The classic cliché test is pinching yourself; however, this test does not work because you can experience pain in dreams. Instead, try one of the following:</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px\">a. Nose Plugging: Plug your nose and try to breathe in. Unlike in waking life, you will be able to breathe through your plugged nose when dreaming. </p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px\">b. Counting Fingers: Look at your hands and count your fingers. For some reason, the mind has a hard time maintaining 10 fingers while dreaming.</p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">Aim to test your state every hour while awake. The goal is to make it a habit that will transfer into your dreams. If you can breathe through your plugged nose or have more or less than 10 fingers, this means you have failed your state test and you are dreaming. </p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">2) Mnemonic Induction of Lucid Dreams (MILD): Before bed, set an intention to have a lucid dream. Then imagine yourself becoming conscious in a dream. Fall asleep like normal. I usually say, “Next time I am in a dream, I realize I am dreaming.” Setting this intention significantly increased the frequency of my lucid dreams. </p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">3) Wake Back To Bed (WBTB): Before bed, set an alarm to go off four and half hours after you go to sleep. Once this alarm goes off, get up and do something for fifteen minutes (preferably something related to dreams). Repeat the MILD technique and then go back to sleep as normal. Then set alarms for every ninety minutes thereafter, except go back to sleep immediately after recording your dreams. This technique is designed to wake you up in the middle of the dreaming portion of your sleep cycle, which helps with dream recall. This worked for me immediately, doubling the number of dreams I could recall each night. Because it is crucial to sleep for a full eight hours, I suggest going to bed fifteen minutes earlier in anticipation of the sleep lost with this technique. </p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">Once you can induce lucidity with these techniques, you will need to practice stabilizing your lucid dreams. The first few times I induced a lucid dream, I focused too much on remaining conscious and woke myself up. The reverse happened as well, where I became conscious in a dream but focused so much on the dream narrative that I forgot I was dreaming and lost lucidity. This balance between maintaining conscious awareness and maintaining the dream world is crucial to stabilizing lucid dreams. It takes practice to learn how much you should focus on the dream world versus reminding yourself you are in a dream to maintain consciousness. After inducing several lucid dreams and many trial-and-error attempts, I learned to achieve this balance. Now I can stay conscious in my dreams for prolonged periods of time without waking myself up or losing lucidity. Using these techniques from the book, I am now able to induce lucidity regularly and consciously maintain my dream world. </p>\n\n<p class=\"body\"><i>Exploring the World of Lucid Dreaming</i> gave me the necessary tools to dream consciously, and I have used the techniques with great success. It is easy to practice because sleep is a major part of how people spend their day. I look forward to improving my skills and finding new ways to enhance my life with lucid dreaming. I highly recommend picking up a copy of <i>Exploring the World of Lucid Dreaming</i>, so you too can learn to dream consciously.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">References</p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">LaBerge, S., &#038; Rheingold, H.

This saying had no meaning to me until I found out how competitive getting into a clinical psychology graduate program is. To be a qualified candidate, I would need to gain clinical experience before I even applied. Thus, I started my journey to obtain this clinical experience in the spring of 2019 in preparation for writing my graduate applications in the fall of 2020.</p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">Finding an internship that satisfied the requirement of clinical experience was at first burdensome. I found many opportunities, but they weren’t a fit for me based upon things such as the internship’s location, skill requirements, or required hours per week. This changed when I joined the <a><a href=\"https://www.nvpsychology.org/ \">Nevada Psychological Association</a> in May of 2019. Through this association, I was able to network with two local private practices that have a joint partnership, Desert Psychological and Odyssey Wellness, who gave me the opportunity to perform various tasks around the office and observe testing.</p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">In the summer of 2019, I began my internship at Desert Psychological and Odyssey Wellness. I started out being trained to operate the front desk of the clinic. I learned a variety of things, such as how to work with patients of all ages and backgrounds.  I also got accustomed to the necessary paperwork for certain clients and their appointments, and I learned how to schedule clients. In addition, I learned how to interpret insurance information and how to operate the Veteran Affairs’ client portal, and I came to understand the many types of testing and therapies my clinic offered. After mastering my training of the front desk to the point where I was able to run it by myself, I started to sit in with a doctor to observe. I sat in on police candidate evaluations for Boulder City Police Department and Henderson Police Department. During these observations I got to see how a clinician conducts a Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale and administers the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI). I got the opportunity to score an MMPI by hand and observe diagnostic intakes, during which the clinician meets with a patient and gathers information to direct future appointments.  During this observation I got to observe how a clinician directs the conversation to evoke responses from a patient as well as how to properly record that information for future use.</p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">I have learned a lot so far at my internship and developed many skills to benefit not only my graduate school application but also my growth as a future clinical psychologist. Being able to start interacting with clients at an early stage has allowed me to start thinking about what population of people I want to work with in the future. For example, I found myself enjoying working with veterans more than children. Coming to this realization before applying to graduate school helps me narrow down the target population I would want to research during graduate school. Likewise, having experience with patient paperwork has given me the advantage to understand the clerical component of running a private practice.</p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">I got into this internship because I wanted to prepare for graduate school.  Because graduate school admissions are really competitive, anything you can do to enhance your qualifications is a huge benefit. However, internships have benefits that extend past graduate school applications.  Benefits include gaining valuable industry knowledge, networking with people in your profession, and developing professional skills. Perhaps most important, an internship can be an excellent way to “try out” your planned career. </p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">It is true that the early bird gets the worm, but it should also be said that it is never too late to gain experience. If you the reader are considering applying for graduate school, I highly recommend getting into an internship, so you can start gaining industry experience as soon as possible. To begin searching for an internship, I recommend first crafting your CV or updating it if you already have one. When working on your CV, you should focus on listing skills you have that an employer could use. Consider skills you gained from your personal hobbies and extracurricular interests, alongside skills you gained from volunteering, paid work, and academic studies.</p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">Once you have a CV, the key to finding an internship is networking. You can network in many ways.  One way is to ask your colleagues if they have an internship or have had an internship that might suit your interests. Another way is to make use of the many campus resources such as the <a><a href=\"https://www.unlv.edu/careerservices/jobs-internships\">Career Services Center</a>, which keeps an up-to-date list of internships and often hosts career fairs with businesses that take interns. Clubs and organizations are also great locations for networking as they often invite outside professionals and businesses to speak. </p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">You might find it difficult to get a suitable internship, much like I did.  I encourage you to persevere and network until you find an internship that fits you. Completing an internship can help you maximize your potential. The hard work you sow now will help you reap benefits in your later education and career. So get out there and start networking.</p>\n\n<hr size=\"15\">\n<p class=\"bodytext\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http://img.faculty.unlv.edu/lab/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Author-Photo-DONE.jpg\" alt=\"Bryce\" width=\"194\" height=\"232\" align=\"left\" hspace=\"5\" vspace=\"5\">Bryce Robinson has been a member of the Interactive Measurement Group since Spring 2019.

However, if you want to do research, you need to pick one or more specific topics to study.  I myself am interested in many research topics and have a tendency to take on too many projects and feel overwhelmed.  I’ve met several students who have the same issue.  I’ve also met students who weren’t sure where their interests lay and who waited for inspiration to strike rather than diving in.</p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">Picking your research topics is hard.  I had an insight that I hope will inspire you to make these difficult choices: Picking your research topics is like deciding what to eat at a smorgasbord.  With smorgasbords and with research topics, there are several different strategies and errors one can make.</p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">Scenarios</p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">Ashley was hungry.  She went to a smorgasbord. There were so many wonderful things to eat, she couldn’t choose.  She looked and looked, but she couldn’t make up my mind.  Eventually, a staff person told her they were closing and she needed to leave.  She hadn’t decided, and then it was too late to decide.</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px\">Alex loves research.  There are so many interesting topics, he finds it difficult to choose between them.  It’s a big commitment to pick one topic to study for all of graduate school and perhaps for his whole life.  So, after graduating, he took a gap year, trying to figure out what he wanted to study.  After a year, Alex wasn’t any closer to deciding, and so he just stayed with the retail job he had.  He hoped to save up money for graduate school while he figured out what he wanted to do.  After two years, he realized that none of his professors would remember him, and so he would need to take more classes to get letters of recommendation.  After five years, he realized his GRE results weren’t valid anymore, and so he would have to take the exam again (and study for it again).  He hadn’t decided what area to study, and so now he probably wouldn’t go to graduate school at all. </p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px\">I’ve never seen a person go to a smorgasbord and leave without eating.  However, I have seen students fail to create a plan for what to do after they complete their undergraduate degree, and end up not applying their degree either to a career or to further education.  This breaks my heart.  Let’s avoid having this happen to you. </p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">Brian went to a buffet.  The food looked great and so he piled his plate as high as he could.  He took the teetering plate back to his table, holding it carefully with two hands as he weaved through the tables and people.  He tried really hard, but he couldn’t eat it all.  He ate until he was completely stuffed.  When he went to leave, his pants were tight, and he felt bloated and nauseous.  He had turned something he liked (eating) into something that he disliked (feeling ill).</p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">Bianca was so excited about research that she jumped at the opportunity to join new projects.  After a while, she had multiple projects going with each of her co-authors.  This sometimes made it hard to keep track of where each project was, but she so enjoyed starting new projects that she couldn’t help herself from diving in.  After a while, she noticed that she was neglecting some projects.  She felt guilty about letting people down, and so she worked evenings and weekends, trying to get caught up.  It was impossible though.  She was overwhelmed.  Like Brian, she had turned something she liked into something that made her feel bad. </p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px\">This happens all too often.  I see this every time I go to a buffet: people eating more than they should and making themselves sick.  But I also see this in research.  Graduate school is demanding and students have to work really hard to get through it.  But when people continue on to their careers, they often keep this same schedule, sacrificing their person lives and making themselves stressed and unhappy.  Ideally, we would find some sort of balance, so we don’t make ourselves sick with too much food or too much work. </p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">Clara went to a smorgasbord.  There were so many choices, it was hard to decide what to have.  So she piled her plate with the same things her friend was having.  Some of the food was good, but a lot of it was too greasy or too salty for her taste.  She forced it all down, so it wouldn’t go to waste.  She thought she was playing it safe, but really she just guaranteed she wouldn’t get what she liked the most. </p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px\">Charles liked research, but wasn’t sure what topic he should study.  His graduate school mentor was interested in one particular topic and provided suggestions for Charles’s thesis and dissertation.  Charles learned a lot about this topic and eventually was able to design his own studies within that research area.  He wasn’t really all that excited about this area, but it was easier to study things that interested his mentor than to make his own choices.  He thought he was playing it safe, but he gave up the opportunity of finding something he truly loved.</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px\">I’m not sure if this happens at smorgasbords, but it does happen in research.  When students are unable to develop sufficient interest in their mentors’ topics during graduate school, they are unable to push through the difficult times.  They either drop out of graduate school or switch mentors to find a better topic. Switching mentors is okay (and much better than dropping out), but you do lose time learning about the new area.  When you first start working with a mentor, try to find a topic that really motivates you.</p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">Dean liked crab legs. He went to an all-you-can-eat seafood buffet and piled his plate with them.  With careful balancing, he could get 10 of them on his plate in a single towering pile.  He devoured the first couple, snapping the shells so the juices squirted out at him, poking out the meat with the special fork.  Then he slowed down, gnawing away like it was a chore.  The last couple weren’t really appetizing, but, hey, they were crab legs, and he liked them, right?  Besides, this was all-you-can-eat, and he was going to get his money’s worth. </p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">His plate finished, Dean sat back and surveyed the scene.  All around, other people ate a variety of foods, delicious smells of spicy soups, fried rice, garlic potatoes.  His mouth watered, and he decided he wasn’t really full.  So he went back to get more crab legs.</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px\">Danielle specialized in one kind of research and had become was a real expert in the area. It was easy for her to design those studies, analyze that data, and write up those results.  She sometimes thought of herself as a research-and-publishing machine.  On the other hand, she sometimes felt like she was in a rut, that she wasn’t doing anything new or innovative or interesting.</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px\">She looked at her colleagues.  Some had several research interests.  She shook her head at them, sure that focusing on one area was the way to be efficient and productive.  On the other hand, she saw that some of those people were inventing new ideas and make breath-taking discoveries.  She wasn’t sure how that happened, because she hadn’t had any new insights about her own research area for many years.</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px\">Focusing on one thing can be great, boosting productivity and creativity, especially if you love one particular topic.  But focusing too narrowly or for too long can undermine your original interest and creativity.</p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">Emily loved buffets.  There were so many choices.  She walked along each of the counters, looking everything over before taking anything. Then, on her first pass, she took a tiny bit of many different things: some tabouli salad, a dab of mashed potatoes, a slice of turkey, a piece of salmon, a California roll.  She returned to her table excited to try them all.  This was delicious.  That was okay.  That one was strange, but she was glad she had tried it.  Her friends were still working their way through their overly filled plates when she was ready for more.  She had picked out four things she loved and joyfully went back for more.  She prowled the counters again and found a couple more things to try.  On her third round, she had a bit more noodle soup, wryly amused that she had gotten her courses backwards.  After that, she was pleasantly full.  She had eaten the very best food, but not too much of it.  She felt great.</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px\">Erik loved problem-solving, connecting ideas, trying new things.  There were so many interesting research areas, each with its own knowledge base, classical problems, and technical challenges.  From his courses, he had learned a little bit about many different areas, giving him a broad overview of the field. But that didn’t tell him what research problems he should study.  So he tried projects in several different areas.  He learned something from each project.  From one project, he learned he liked cleaning data.  From another, that mouse pee smells disgusting.  From a third, he discovered his passion for social justice.</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px\">Over the next few years, Erik expanded the projects he liked and looked for new projects that were similar.  Eventually, he settled into three major research areas that he found fulfilling and important.  As opportunities arose, he dabbled in other areas, always starting small, so that he didn’t commit himself to a large project that he wasn’t sure he would enjoy.</p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">I recommend you try several different research topics before committing yourself.  Find out what kinds of work you like to do, what topics inspire you, what environments you want to work in, what kinds of technical skills you like to use.  Once you have found areas that suit you, pursue them, but consider other interesting opportunities as they arise.  Don’t let your enthusiasm fracture your interest across too many projects. Don’t let advice about how to get ahead force you into focusing on a single topic until you’ve lost all interest.  Your productivity and creativity will be greater if you find a limited number of topics that truly interest you.</p>\n\n<hr size=\"15\">\n\n<p class=\"bodytext\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http://img.faculty.unlv.edu/lab/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Barchard-2014-crop-DONE.jpg\" alt=\"Dr. Barhcard\" width=\"205\" height=\"200\" align=\"left\" hspace=\"5\" vspace=\"5\">Kimberly A.

They were both exciting and intellectually challenging puzzles.  Once I started my university career, I found myself drawn to the study of psychopaths and their crimes. Recently I went further into the research in this fascinating field of study by reading <em>Snakes in Suits</em> by Paul Babiak and Robert D. Hare, which details how psychopaths function in the workplace. I think this book can be a useful tool for both for people who are already in the workforce and for people like myself who are still in school. </p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">The “snakes” we find in this book refer to psychopaths in the workplace. Alternating between the work of scientists &#8212; including the authors &#8212; and fictional narratives, this book lays out what psychopaths seek, how they go about achieving it, and how their behavior affects those around them. One part of the book particularly stood out to me: many psychopaths apply a three-step process to achieve their goal: assessment (figuring out who is of value to them), manipulation (they put up a façade to gain the trust of others so they can use them), and abandonment (they abandon the person after they are of no use to them).</p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">Babiak and Hare provide an example of this process in a fictional narrative about Dave. Dave is a psychopath who starts working at a new office by faking his credentials. He gets the job easily because he is charming and seems qualified. However, things take a turn for the worst really fast. Dave’s boss Frank and his coworker Dorothy are the first to experience Dave’s manipulation. Dave takes credit for Dorothy’s hard work and manipulates Frank so much that Frank questions his own sanity. After moving up the ladder, Dave then abuses people on his team to the point that they ask to be relocated. Before Frank can set things straight, Dave successfully gets Frank fired by the top boss and becomes his replacement! This devastates the whole office. Reading this book, I felt as excited and fascinated as I felt back when I watched the crime dramas that first sparked my interest in psychology. However, I also felt horrified, because psychopaths are real people, causing havoc in their workplaces.</p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">One of the most alarming things I realized from reading this book is that many of the traits psychopaths possess (charm, confidence, and strength) are traits organizations look for when hiring somebody &#8212; especially for positions of power like managers and CEOs. Although psychopaths make up only 2% of the overall population, the damage they can cause to an organization and its employees is devastating. They can cause similar disruption if they are in our research labs or our group projects for a class.</p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">How can the shocking facts and narratives found in this book help someone like me, who is currently a student and about to become a professional? <em>Snakes in Suits</em> raises awareness to help us protect ourselves and others. By getting a peek into the process of how a psychopath works, we are better prepared to see past their lies and manipulation. It also made me realize how important it is to speak up against bullying and deceit in the workplace. Sometimes the person being manipulated doesn’t know they are being used, but it might be obvious to those around them. Therefore, it is important we look out for our colleagues and coworkers.  And if we find ourselves being abused by coworkers or supervisors, we need to remember that there is no shame in coming forward; even the best of us can be deceived.</p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">How can we avoid being put in this situation in the first place?  When you meet someone who is charming, don’t bend the rules.  Check references.  Check credentials.  When you are considering hiring or promoting someone or just letting them into our research lab, get feedback from several people, ideally including both people who are equal or above them in status and those who are below them in status.  Note if they are abusive or manipulative towards anyone.  However, all these precautions won’t be enough.  Most of us have little control over who our co-workers are, who our fellow lab members are, and often even who we work with on a term project.  Therefore, I highly recommend this book to everyone, regardless of current or future profession. Such knowledge may be invaluable someday to protect yourself, a peer, or your entire organization from becoming a victim of a snake in a suit.</p>\n\n<hr size=\"15\">\n<p class=\"bodytext\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http://img.faculty.unlv.edu/lab/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Jelsy-Lab-Picture-2in-x-3.5in-DONE.jpg\" alt=\"Jelsy\" width=\"150\" height=\"215\" align=\"left\" hspace=\"5\" vspace=\"3\">Jelsy has been a member of the Interactive Measurement Group since Fall 2018.

The writing is going well for the first hour, but then you get a notification from your phone.  You try to ignore it, but you keep thinking about it.  Finally, you give in, planning to check it quickly and get back to work.  However, you quickly get sucked into a wave of social media, which then spirals into a black hole of notifications and distractions. This process has now eaten up twice the amount of time you potentially could have spent writing. That one little distraction interrupted your state of flow.</p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">Flow is best defined as a state where your concentration and engagement are fully focused on the activity you are pursuing.  When you are in a state of flow, you are able to be productive while forgetting about outside influences such as space, and time.  Dr. Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi developed this theory after studying experts in a variety of fields. These experts said they could work on their tasks for hours, ignoring food and sleep, because they were so engaged.  People in a state of flow say that they were “in the zone!” and “on a roll!”, and that “time really flew!” However, getting into a state of flow can be hard. As shown in the matrix, the best way to achieve this state is by having high levels of both challenge and skill. If your skill is not equal to the challenge, you may feel anxiety.  If the task is not challenging compared to your skill level, you might feel relaxed, but you won’t achieve the high levels of productivity that come with flow state.</p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">This theory helped me understand why I sometimes felt anxious when working on big assignments and why it sometimes took me a while to settle into those assignments. Last semester, I had a paper due for one of my classes, and it was initially hard for me to sit down and write. I realized that my difficulty in achieving a state of flow might have stemmed from two things: distractions and a mismatch between my skills and the challenge posed by the paper. </p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">Therefore, I put away all distractions away.  I cleared off my desk, turned off my cell phone, and closed my door.  Next, I looked through my notes and course materials to see where my challenge level was at. Doing this, I realized that I knew a lot more about the paper topic than I had originally thought.  Now that I knew my skills were up to the challenge, I was able to quickly achieve a flow state and finish the rough draft of my paper! </p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">While I have known about the terrible power of distractions for a long time, it is only recently that I learned how to manufacture writing situations to facilitate flow.  I can make a writing task easier or harder to match my skill level.  If writing a paper is initially too hard, I can start by reviewing my notes and copying relevant materials into a new file.  This increases my skills and decreases the challenge simultaneously.  If a writing assignment is initially boring because it is too easy, I can challenge myself to write it in half the time or I can deliberately make the writing more difficult, for example, by strenuously avoiding passive voice or by doubling the number of references.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">By avoiding distractions and matching my skill level to the challenge before me, I have been finding it easier to achieve that desired state of fully engaged productivity.  I hope these strategies help you achieve flow state more often in your own writing.</p>\n\n<hr size=\"15\">\n<p class=\"bodytext\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http://img.faculty.unlv.edu/lab/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/43F22A15-CBFF-4AD5-9D00-9FA686C0D798-1-e1573098199181.jpg\" alt=\"Francesca\" width=\"200\" height=\"216\" align=\"left\" hspace=\"5\" vspace=\"3\">Francesca Alonzi is a junior at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, where she is pursuing a degree in Criminal Justice with a minor in Psychology.

We were instructed to design an erect object through the use of 20 pieces of spaghetti, tape, some string, and a marshmallow, which had to sit atop the structure. This was all to be completed in approximately 10 minutes time. Altogether, a rather vexing and disconcerting task! Hence, we commenced our preparations and dutifully engaged with onerous toil on the assignment before us. At moments interspersed throughout the activity, I took brief pauses of respite to gather my thoughts and think carefully about what I was to do next. I could detect a palpable sense of urgency in my groupmates, as the clock seemed to tick faster by the minute. We decided after hastened deliberation that the best method of attack was to use tape to secure joists of spaghetti together, elongated and overlapping, and subsequently use the thread to focus the structure into a concentric point, all while surmounting the marshmallow on top. Superficially, it did not seem that complicated. But practically? It called for an adept and shrewd thought process. We had a plan in mind, and we pursued this with an ardor akin to that of the most focused laborer.</p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">As the pieces were beginning to fall into place, I could feel incipient jubilation welling up inside me, but I restrained myself until the task was done; I would not allow myself to be swayed by premature celebration. We were as a cohesive unit in a task fit appropriately to each of our specifications. I operated the thread, J.D. the spaghetti, and Lindsay the tape. We were united in this charge, focused and pertinacious in the pursuit of our goal. However, this ordeal was not without its hiccups. There were many a failed attempt at linking the spaghetti together, and the tape was completely exhausted before the completion of the final product. Despite these mistakes, we were unrelenting and imperturbable, not stopping until the task was done. All of this was occurring through the simultaneous tumult of the other groups hard at work on their respective structures, offering innumerable instances for distraction from our activity. However, I was not swayed by these potential interactions, preferring to focus only on the expressions and articulations of my own groupmates.</p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">Eventually, we were able to make some headway and developed a glorious, free-standing structure, albeit leaning. It was only at this moment that we began to pay attention to the surrounding uproar that was the rest of the lab. As we peered around the room, we were able to discern the competing structures, ominous and imposing, in the craft of our lab mates. At this point, J.D., with a most magisterial pronouncement, declared that we needed to make the structure taller. I immediately commenced internal monologue. Would the structure hold? Were we to add even more height to what was already perceived to be an unstable and uncertain mass? As I was about to interject and demur on his point, I looked at Lindsay, who was also nodding in agreement at this plan. It was then that I decided on siding with their idea. Would it not be an even more grand and picturesque an image, if we were to raise it even higher, thereby securing our victory? I will admit, victory was not our primary concern, despite being concomitant with the enjoyment of the task, but it would surely elevate our success and further ingrain in our minds a stronger sense of completion. Hence, we triumphantly chased after the elegance of victory!</p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">When we finally finished the project, we looked at the leaning structure with admiration. It was finally done, the product of our toil and exacting precision. I took a moment to reflect and learn from my team members. It was undoubtedly thanks to their prowess that this formidable structure was able to stand on its own. There was something about their work ethic and drive that instilled in me a recurrent desire to do the same. I paused, took a look at them, and suddenly saw the excellence that I strive for each day. What an exciting and amazing time, to be working with such capable and visionary individuals!\n<p class=\"body\">Reader, have you been afforded the opportunity to interact with understanding and sagacious wit like that which I describe? Opportunities like this offer great personal advancement and the chance to grow and develop one’s own faculties effectively. In fact, I encourage you to take up complex and challenging tasks. The resulting development will only be to your benefit. Anyone who is a new member in an organization or group should force themselves outside their comfort zone in order to facilitate growth. The discomfort will be ephemeral. As for the learning and development? Immutable.</p>\n\n<hr size=\"15\">\n<p class=\"bodytext\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http://img.faculty.unlv.edu/lab/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Fitsum-Ayele-cropped.jpg\" alt=\"Fits\" width=\"194\" height=\"232\" align=\"left\" hspace=\"5\" vspace=\"3\">Fitsum Ayele is currently a junior majoring in psychology with a minor in management.

Climate change is disrupting more than just the weather: It drastically alters the life cycles of animals and plants, who often cannot adapt quickly enough, and it is making millions of climate refugees.  The world will be a different place in 20 or 50 years.  And what is my place in this world?  I’m just finishing my undergraduate degree.  What field will I go into?  What careers will I pursue?  This last summer, I completed a research program that helps answer all these questions.</p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">I found out about the research opportunity in South Dakota through the Honors College at UNLV. A few weeks after sending in my application, transcripts, and letter of recommendation, I got the news that I had been accepted!  I would be living in South Dakota for two months in the summer. I had never lived outside of Las Vegas and didn’t know anyone else in the program, but I was excited to embrace these new challenges and see where this opportunity would take me. </p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">A week before the program I flew out to Rapid City to get acquainted with my new home. Housing was covered as part of the program, so I ended up residing in a dorm on campus. As a commuter student at UNLV, I had never lived in a dorm.  It took a while for me to adjust, but I eventually fell in love with my new home. This program helped me become more adaptable and confident, even before the research had begun.</p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">There were three summer research groups living in the dorms, which allowed me to interact with students from around the globe. I was part of BuG ReMeDEE, which focused on analyzing the genomes of bacteria from extreme environments to better understand how genome editing could help combat increasing methane levels in the atmosphere. I attended up to four seminars every week: these focused on data analysis, experimental design, communications, and poster design and presentation. Each student was given a different faculty mentor and worked on a different project centered on methanotrophic bacteria. I worked alongside Dr. Dhiman, a post-doctoral candidate in the chemical and biological engineering department. Using very expensive software that I would otherwise not have access to, we were able to analyze the Cytochrome C protein. These novel analyses established a foundation that other research could build upon to reduce greenhouse gases. After my work in the lab was complete each day, I would hang out with other students in the program, whether that be going out on the town or staying in and watching a movie in the dorms. </p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">Although the whole summer was building up to a poster presentation at the end of July, I felt like there was a good balance between work and play. I became incredibly close with the other students in the program. Contrary to popular belief, there was plenty to do in South Dakota. We explored the Badlands National Park, Mt. Rushmore, Custer State Park, and downtown Rapid City. We even had the opportunity to explore the Sanford Underground Research Facility, which is where the samples of methanotrophs were collected. </p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">At the end of July, students from all three programs traveled to Sioux Falls, South Dakota, where we participated in an Undergraduate Research Symposium. We got to present our research and network with other students who were working under the same National Science Foundation grant that we were.  We were all in this together to fight climate change!</p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">By the time we got to the symposium, I knew my presentation forwards and backwards. The program did a terrific job of preparing us to present in front of people and even helped us with poster design. Because this wasn’t my first time presenting, I was also able to provide a lot of feedback to the other individuals in my Summer Undergraduate Research Experience. I like that I was able to help other people working on this important topic.</p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">I signed up for this program because I was looking for something exciting to do over the summer that would enhance my resume. It helped me grow as a person and allowed me to forge so many beautiful friendships with people around the world.  BuG ReMeDEE also gave me an opportunity to grow as a scholar.  It prompted me to look into MD/PhD programs, as I fell even deeper in love with the process of research and the thrill that comes along with presenting my hard work.  I’m not sure yet what area I will pursue, but I know the future will be challenging, and I’m ready to meet that challenge. </p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">I cannot overstate the importance of doing research during your undergraduate career. These research experiences set you apart from other candidates when you apply to graduate school. Joining a research lab at your local university is an important first step. However, I highly recommend taking your research a step further and seeking out opportunities at other universities in order to set yourself apart from other applicants. The UNLV Honors College told me about this particular research opportunity.  However, similar opportunities can be found by doing a simple Google search.  A little investigation now may help propel you into the uncertain future in a direction you feel good about, setting your course for years to come.</p>\n\n<hr size=\"15\">\n<p class=\"bodytext\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http://img.faculty.unlv.edu/lab/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Headshot.png\" alt=\"Jennifer\" width=\"194\" height=\"204\" align=\"left\" hspace=\"5\" vspace=\"5\">Jennifer Frazee has been a member of the Interactive Measurement Group since Summer 2017.

Barchard</em></p>\n<table border=\"0\" width=\"814\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p class=\"body\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http://img.faculty.unlv.edu/lab/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Content-Photo-1-DONE.jpg\" alt=\"Car\" width=\"301\" height=\"200\" align=\"right\" hspace=\"5\" vspace=\"15\"></p>\n<p class=\"body\">Four-wheel driving over uneven terrain requires two skills: driving and spotting.  When the terrain is difficult, one person drives and the other spots.  The driver is inside the vehicle, steering around obstacles, operating the gas and brake (sometimes simultaneously), and using advanced features like locking differentials and traction control.  The spotter is outside the vehicle, examining the terrain from all angles, looking under the vehicle to check clearance, and planning the route.  The spotter tells the driver which direction to go, when to start and stop, when to reverse, and when to power over an obstacle.</p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">Recently, my husband and I bought a high-clearance four-wheel drive vehicle so we could get to places we want to hike.  For the first time in my life, I wanted to drive off-road.  I signed us up for a two-day course at the <a href=\"http://ohv.parks.ca.gov/?page_id=1221\">Prairie City Off-Road Vehicle Recreation Area.</a></p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">Driving was fun!  I was relaxed and calm, unworried by driving the most difficult routes of my life.  I trusted my spotters (sometimes my husband, sometimes the instructor) to give me good directions and so avoid damage to the vehicle or injury to myself or the bystanders.  Furthermore, I was good at it!  I could work the gas and brake to keep the vehicle going at a slow steady speed over rocks, dips, and ridges.  I could reverse with control so we didn’t lose more ground than needed.  And I could hold the steering wheel steady so we kept on the planned route despite the uneven obstacles.</p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">Spotting was both challenging and scary.  I tried to imagine where the four wheels would go and how we could get around the tall rocks.  Should we go around to the left or could we clear that center rock by keeping our tires high on the two sides?  I thought I’d be able to plan our route by watching the other vehicles drive that course.  I was wrong.  Every vehicle is different: different length, different wheel distance, different torque. So, what works for one vehicle might be inappropriate for another.  Moreover, watching the other vehicles increased my anxiety.  One vehicle tilted sharply as it drove up the side-slope to avoid a boulder.  Another vehicle wobbled up and down with one wheel four feet in the air!  So, watching the other vehicles didn’t help me plan: it just made me more nervous about spotting.</p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">Eventually, it was our turn.  I’d put it off as long as I could.  At first, I directed my husband to drive to the right, avoiding one nasty rock.  That was the easy part.  But then we came to the steep gully and the jutting rocks.  I walked all around the vehicle, looking at things from every angle, and eventually picked a route.  Several minutes later, I was proud that we’d completed the route without hitting any part of the vehicle on the terrain.  With the mentoring of the instructor, we succeeded! </p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">Like four-wheel driving, research requires two skills: driving and spotting.  Driving includes creating online and in-person study materials, collecting data on MTurk or through in-person appointments, scoring tests, entering data, analyzing data with SPSS and R, writing your APA-style paper, and presenting your research at conferences.  Spotting includes reviewing the literature to identify key themes, envisioning research questions that address holes in the literature, designing studies to test your hypotheses, and explaining the importance and implications of your results.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">Both skills are essential.  It does no good to ask large samples to complete beautifully formatted measures if the research question is trivial or the design does not allow causal inferences.  This would be like the driver successfully powering up a side slope, because the spotter told them to, and then the vehicle tipping over.  Similarly, elegant research designs from the driver are worthless if they are not implemented by the spotter: if the random assignment is not completed, if the standardized procedures are not followed, if the database is filled with data entry errors, if the statistical procedures are applied improperly.  This would be like the spotter telling the driver to head right to avoid a trough, but the driver heading left, sticking a wheel right into the hole, and breaking the axle.  Good research requires that drivers and spotters each do their job, that they trust each other, and that they work together to bring the research to fruition.</p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">When a student first starts to do research, they won’t be good at either of these skills.  Typically, they will work with a faculty or graduate student mentor who will act as both a spotter and a driving coach: the mentor will select the research question and guide the student in how to administer the study, analyze the data, and write the paper.  The mentor will ensure that study protocols are fulfilled so that the participants are protected and so that the data can be validly used to answer the desired research question.  As the student gains driving skills, the mentor will explain the research area, encourage the student to read key papers, and help the student craft their own research questions.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">As the student completes their masters and moves on to their PhD, they are expected to generate their own research questions and study designs, while their mentor and thesis committee provide feedback and advice.  At this point, the student often starts mentoring junior researchers on the nuts-and-bolts of completing a study, becoming a driving coach themselves.  Completing the PhD is the benchmark that marks when a student is considered both a competent driver – able to collect and analyze data and present the results verbally and in written form – and also a competent independent spotter – able to select worthy research questions, design their own studies, and place those studies within the broader literature.</p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">As you develop your research skills, work to develop both your driving and your spotting skills.  Recognize that some of the necessary steps may be difficult or scary.  Trust your mentors to help you learn the necessary skills without harm to yourself, your research participants, or your study quality.  Finally, don’t imagine that this process ever finishes.  When you enter a new research area, some of your driving and spotting skills will cross over, but many will not.  Just as I needed mentors to teach me driving and spotting skills for four-wheel driving, when you enter any new research area, you will need new mentors who can teach you the technical skills and theoretical issues.  Seek out partners and mentors whose skills complement your own so you can form an effective collaborative team.</p>\n\n<hr size=\"15\">\n<p class=\"bodytext\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http://img.faculty.unlv.edu/lab/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Kim-photo-DONE.jpg\" alt=\"Kimberly\" width=\"300\" height=\"143\" align=\"left\" hspace=\"5\" vspace=\"1\">Kimberly A.

Now a junior in college and being under constant stress, I have returned to art to enhance my mental health. Drawing, painting, and 3D-designing have drastically improved my mental health by giving me a creative outlet that allows me to take control of my emotions one stroke at a time.</p>\n<p class=\"body\">Prior to using art to improve my mental health, I often bottled up my emotions. My anxiety plagued me in social situations. My frustrations irritated me to no end. I was also afflicted with bouts of stress from worldly matters. Without changing my external circumstances, I found tranquility in the art I was making by creating pieces that reflected my emotions. </p>\n<p class=\"body\">Many people are afraid to make art, believing they have no artistic talent and can never get better. I believed I had no artistic capabilities for most of my life. However, this changed during my senior year of high school when I decided to draw anyway, using whatever talent my body possessed. Through practice, I cultivated my skills and improved. The key is to take a leap and make some art. Skill can come later.</p>\n<p class=\"body\">If the task of making art is still daunting, start out small. I recommend beginning with a sticky note, as many people are intimidated with filling a whole sheet of paper. Next, visualize the type of drawing you wish to create while taking your emotions into account. Consider using specific colors to aid in the transfer of your emotions, such as using red to reflect your anger or yellow to express your happiness. If you’re anxious, frustrated, or stressed, visualize those feelings and attempt to draw them. Personally, I take deep breaths while I attempt to visualize my stress onto the canvas: this allows me to experience a release of pressure and come to peace with my emotions. In the end, it does not matter what your drawing looks like. The process of physically drawing out one’s emotions on paper, regardless of what was drawn or the quality of the drawing, helps reduce anxiety and other negative emotions (Mercer, Warson, &#038; Zhao, 2010). The end goal is to use the process of making art as a way to help better understand and control your emotions.</p>\n<p class=\"body\">In the end, art is about self-expression. When making art, let your pencil, pen, paintbrush &#8212; or whatever media you choose to use &#8212; be an extension of your body. Think of your artistic tools as a way to transfer your emotions directly from your consciousness onto the canvas. For me, the process of making art has been an invaluable form of emotional therapy, and I encourage everyone to try it out for themselves.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">Reference</p>\n<div style=\"padding-left: 4em; text-indent: -4em;\">\n<p>Mercer, A., Warson, E., &#038; Zhao, J.

Part autobiography, part writer’s toolbox, <i>On Writing</i> lays out the events in King’s life that led to his development as a writer and the tools he uses to weave his stories. At just over 280 pages, the book is full of wisdom, which King delivers with honesty and a sharp wit. <i>On Writing</i> renewed my interest in writing fiction as a hobby, helped shape my writing style, enhanced my academic writing, and reminded me to stay true to myself. </p>\n\n<p class=\"body\"><i>On Writing</i> reminded me of how exciting I found storytelling as a kid and renewed my interest in writing fiction as a hobby. I was the stereotypical youngster, demanding a bedtime story each night before I went to sleep. When I finally learned to read on my own, I would indulge myself in any story I could get my hands on, and often dabbled in writing short tales, crafting poor imitations of the ones I read. As I got older, I began to neglect my creativity; gradually, writing was put aside in order to pursue academics and other hobbies. I often longed to return to the more imaginative days of my youth. King’s personal tale of how writing served as a conduit for his creativity helped me rediscover my own creative drive. Once again, I have returned to writing fiction, weaving stories full of mythical heroes and powerful magic. <i>On Writing</i> helped me reignite this hobby from my childhood, allowing me to channel my creative energy for personal nourishment.</p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">Many of King’s suggestions in <i>On Writing</i> helped shape my writing style. King urges writers to embrace simplicity wherever possible; it is best to stick with straightforward noun-verb sentences and avoid pitfalls such as passive voice. A particularly helpful suggestion is that first drafts are for getting words on a page and second drafts are for putting all the pieces into a coherent whole. When writing in the past, I often would correct mistakes as they came up, which led to slow progress as I felt each page had to be perfect before I moved on. King’s suggestion, to get the idea on the page and then go back and edit, really helped me avoid focusing too much on the details and instead keep in mind the larger whole of my story. </p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">Surprisingly, many of the suggestions in <i>On Writing</i>, though intended for fiction writers, apply to academic writing as well. I plan to continue my education at the graduate level. The Toolbox portion of <i>On Writing</i> lends a toolset I use to improve the professionalism of my writing and keep up with my assignments. One tool I use to write more professional papers is to remove adverbs from my sentences. This encourages me to eliminate flowery language, which cleans up my papers and ultimately makes my writing clearer and more concise. Another useful tool comes when King discusses writing as a discipline; time should be put aside each day to write or else the writer risks losing interest in the project. Writing each day ensures I will stay on top of my assignments. For academic writing, implementing these tools is crucial for making sure I craft clear, concise papers and meet my deadlines. These tools will help with graduate and undergraduate papers, including an eventual thesis and dissertation. </p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">Amidst these pragmatic tools, King infuses <i>On Writing</i> with a larger point about life, which can be summarized with the eternal axiom “Just Be Yourself.” He repeatedly calls for honesty infused in every page of written word, to showcase a genuine picture of life and to tell a story with all the integrity possible. <i>On Writing</i> really drives this point home: it is important to be authentic, for without authenticity, it is impossible to connect with the self and realize my purpose in life. My life is my story. I must show up to life every day as I am, with all my faults and vulnerabilities. <i>On Writing</i> is a beautiful reminder that authenticity is the key to self-discovery; staying true to myself and the story I am creating will make sure I end up where I need to be. King provides useful writing advice; however, his most important lesson is to always cultivate authenticity, both in writing stories and in living life.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">References</p>\n\n<p>King, S.

For example, my grandparents once pointed out they felt I was not “present” during a conversation because I was scrolling through social media on my phone. I used to think that such opinions came from older generations, ones that did not understand the importance and attraction of social platforms in a highly digitized age. However, I was not sure how much time I was personally spending on social media. I decided to do an observation of my own to see how social media usage was affecting my life and productivity.</p>\n<p class=\"body\">The first thing I had to do was figure out how much time I was spending on social media applications. Thankfully, Apple iPhones have recently come out with new technology that tracks how much you use your phone per day and how much time you spend on each specific app. I was shocked to see my own statistics.  I felt like I was wasting a huge amount of time and became concerned about how social media affected my productivity. As a result, I decided to challenge myself by going a full day without checking my social media accounts.</p>\n<p class=\"body\">The morning of the challenge, I instinctively went on my phone to see what happened on Twitter while I was sleeping. As soon as the blue screen started to load, I remembered the goal I set for myself that day and closed the app. At that moment, I realized this one-day challenge would be more difficult than I initially thought. Determined to succeed, I replaced my social media usage with more important tasks, such as schoolwork and house chores. This made it easier to spend my day offline and worked wonders for my productivity.  </p>\n<p class=\"body\">I got to campus an hour before my class started. It would’ve been easy to kill an hour scrolling through Instagram or Facebook, but instead I used that time to pull out my planner and map out the rest of my week. By doing so, I realized I had an assignment deadline and exam quickly sneaking up on me. Mapping out my week allowed me to plan effectively and prevent rushing as I completed my schoolwork, something that would not have happened if that hour was spent on social media. Arriving at my lecture hall, I noticed many of my peers were on their phones checking social media. Instead of following the crowd, I once again opted for something more productive: I set up my notes for the class and felt ready to begin the lesson. It was already clear to me that social media was indeed a huge distraction for me and spending less time on it could greatly increase my productivity.</p>\n<p class=\"body\">For the remainder of the one-day challenge, I kept replacing social media with healthy and productive activities: I had more time to make a nutritious dinner, I finished my house chores and homework instead of putting them off to the weekend, and I went to the gym earlier than I normally would. These small changes not only increased my productivity but also made me feel better about my personal habits. </p>\n<p class=\"body\">Even though this challenge only lasted 24 hours, it had long-term effects because it made me realize how much time I was wasting. Since my one-day challenge, I have monitored my social media usage and substantially decreased my screen time. I learned to take a step back from others’ online life to focus on my real life in the off-line world; the tweets, photos, and statuses will still be there when I have free time, but first I can do something I want or need to do offline. I’m slowly but continually decreasing my time online and it’s changing my day to day life by improving my productivity. I also have more time to make connections with my friends and family, in person, by listening more attentively and spending more quality time in their presence. Spending a day offline is something many people can benefit from &#8212; I recommend you try it so you can see first-hand how your productivity improves.</p>\n<hr size=\"15\">\n<p class=\"bodytext\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http://img.faculty.unlv.edu/lab/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/43F22A15-CBFF-4AD5-9D00-9FA686C0D798-1-e1573098199181.jpg\" alt=\"Francesca\" width=\"194\" height=\"210\" align=\"left\" hspace=\"5\" vspace=\"0\">Francesca Alonzi has been a member of the Interactive Measurement Group since Spring 2019.

My friends and family know I am stressed when they see my shoulders tense up, almost as if I am holding a shoulder shrug. Luckily, many methods can be used to combat stress &#8212; these include exercise, journaling, meditation, and yoga. Recently, I have tried a combination of meditation and journaling as a form of stress relief.</p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">My mom was the first person to introduce me to meditation. She has done Transcendental Meditation for the past 4 years and says it has not just reduced her stress, but has transformed her life. In the past few months, I have found my own form of mediation that fits into my lifestyle. I primarily use the app <a href=\"https://www.headspace.com/meditation-101/what-is-meditation\">Headspace</a> to guide my meditation. Within the app are categories to help with stress and anxiety, falling asleep and waking up, personal growth, and much more. Each session is guided (a person talks to you throughout the session) and helps you become more aware of your body, your breathing, and where your mind is centered. I focus on meditation for stress and anxiety. Although I have only been meditating for about 4 months, I have already seen valuable differences in the way I deal with stressful moments in my personal, work, and school lives. </p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">Another powerful method of stress reduction for me is journaling. It started in my high school sophomore English class, where we started off each class with journaling for 5 non-stop minutes. For me, the silence and the ability to physically record my thoughts helped me slow down and calm down. I become stressed when my mind starts to run at a million miles per minute. When I take the time to physically write about what I am feeling, I can process what is stressing me at a manageable speed. Sometimes I draw pictures instead of writing words, which brings out my creative side.</p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">In the past few months, I have combined these two forms of stress relief. Some days, I spend 5 or 10 minutes journaling and then jump right into a 10-minute meditation session, and other days I meditate and then I journal. This combination seems to be particularly powerful because I am doing something that calms me (meditation) and then doing something that helps me process my feelings (journaling).  Whatever the reason, I have found that this combination helps reduce my muscle tension and even helps me sleep better.  I recommend that you try combining multiple stress reduction techniques that interest you: often, it’s not a matter of finding the single best method, but of finding the best combination of methods that fit into your own life. Who knows, they may even help relax your shoulders too!</p>\n\n<hr size=\"15\">\n<p class=\"bodytext\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http://img.faculty.unlv.edu/lab/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Asia-Author-Photo-DONE.jpg\" alt=\"Asia\" width=\"194\" height=\"197\" align=\"left\" hspace=\"5\" vspace=\"1\">Asia Chapa has been a member of the Interactive Measurement Group since Spring 2017 and served as Lab Manager from Fall 2017 to Spring 2018.

This is a common refrain for many people, students especially. Who hasn’t wished they could somehow stop the clock and plow through their to-do list?</p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">Prioritizing, organizing, and maximizing productivity won’t magically stop the clock, but they can help us manage our time more efficiently and reduce our sense of being overwhelmed.\nBecause people want to get more done in less time, there are countless apps and programs for working smarter. I love experimenting with these kinds of tools and have tried dozens over the last several years. Here are the apps I use consistently to help me wake up on time, stay focused on my work and avoid distractions on my phone.</p>\n\n<p><u>SpinMe</u></p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">We think we’re doing ourselves a favor by hitting the snooze and getting an extra couple minutes of sleep. The bed may be just too comfy and the prospect of another day just too overwhelming. My former snooze habit occurred to the detriment of my morning workouts and other people in the house trying to sleep. </p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">All this changed when I started using the SpinMe alarm clock app on my phone. The only way to turn off the SpinMe alarm is to hold both of your thumbs to the spots indicated on the screen and spin in circles. Something about spinning around wakes me up enough so that I cannot go back to sleep even if I go back to bed.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">Before going to bed, I set the alarm to the loudest possible and then put my phone in a different (but nearby) room. The more effort you have to expend to get to your phone to spin and turn off the alarm, the more awake you will be afterward. </p>\n\n<p><u>Focus Timer</u></p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">An app that I’m using while writing this article is Focus Timer. It’s a very simple app that minimizes to the menu of my Mac and reminds me that I have, for example, 15:58 minutes left before it’s time to stop writing and take a break. </p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">Focus Timer&#8211;and many other timers like it&#8211;are based on the Pomodoro Technique of focusing on work for 25 minutes and then taking a 5-minute break. The purpose of the break is to give yourself a rest&#8211;both physically and cognitively&#8211;from your work, so you can reenergize and then refocus on your work. Being timed can be a bit motivating, too. How much can you get done in 25 minutes? Based on my experiences, more than you think. </p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">Focus Timer lets you choose the length of your work times and break times. For homework like studying, reading, and writing projects, I like to structure my time in chunks of 45 minutes of work and 15 minutes of break. On these longer breaks, I have enough time to tackle some housework while listening to upbeat music.  </p>\n\n<p><u>Forest</u></p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">If your phone is the biggest source of distraction in your life, you may be hesitant to use yet another app, but one that helped me pay less attention to my phone is Forest. Forest helps you stay focused on your work by guilting you into avoiding the other apps on your phone. You select the length of time you want to remain focused. While you’re fully engaged in your work, you’re growing a cute little tree in your virtual forest. The longer you stay focused by not clicking away from the Forest app, the bigger your tree grows. If you leave the app during one of your focus times, the tree you’re growing dies and shows up as an ugly brown stump in your forest. </p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">Grow lots of trees to create a beautiful forest and to earn coins to buy new species of trees and bushes. Forest frequently adds new species to keep the app interesting and your forest more visually appealing. For an extra dose of motivation, you can donate your coins toward planting real trees around the world. </p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">I hope you find the apps I’ve mentioned here to be truly helpful. However, before using any new app, it’s important to consider what you want to accomplish, how much time it will take, and what that time will take you away from.  After you’ve used a tool for a while, revisit it to decide if it’s helping you achieve the results you wanted and if you still like using it.  After a while, I dreaded using habit tracking apps and giving them up was a load off my mind – and my phone – making me more successful at the habits I valued the most.  If any particular app or tool isn’t working for you, plenty more exist to help you conquer your productivity challenges. Trying them out can be fun and can help you learn more about yourself and how you work best.</p>\n\n<hr size=\"15\">\n<p class=\"bodytext\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http://img.faculty.unlv.edu/lab/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Lindsay-Denecker-bio-photo-cropped-DONE.jpg\" alt=\"Lindsay\" width=\"194\" height=\"215\" align=\"left\" hspace=\"5\" vspace=\"5\">Lindsay Denecker is studying psychology at UNLV in pursuit of her goal to be a lifelong learner.

John experienced many wonderful moments, like working for a world-famous rock band and becoming a father to his beloved son. Despite the adventures of touring and the joys of fatherhood, life was definitely not easy for John. There were many instances in his life where John was bullied or misunderstood by his parents, his classmates, and his coworkers. Reading about these moments got me thinking about how unnecessarily mean some people can be to others.  How different the outcome would have been had people decided to be kind to John. This book made me realize that simple acts of kindness can go a long way. I now appreciate these moments of goodwill more than before and try to spread kindness in my own daily life. </p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">The book describes people being mean to John for no apparent reason. For example, when John was a kid, other kids excluded him from playing with them on the playground. As an adolescent, John still had trouble making friends because people thought he was weird and they wouldn’t even bother to get to know him. If they would’ve treated John kindly and fairly, I am sure they would’ve been delighted to find out what a smart and talented individual he is. However, the people that <i>did</i> treat John with kindness, like his wife, were the people who brought the most joy to his life and the ones who got to know his brilliant mind.</p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">Reading John’s story got me to think of some of my own life experiences. There have been a few instances in my life where a simple act of kindness has made me more optimistic about a negative situation. For example, last semester I was caught up dealing with some personal problems which caused my performance in a class to suffer. I felt disappointed in myself for letting my grade drop, which only made the situation worse. One day after lecture, my professor came up to me as I was packing my things and simply asked me how I was doing. He didn’t mean how I was doing in the class &#8212; he could easily find that out by looking up my scores. Rather he was referring to how I was doing in general. After I explained my circumstance, he gave me a little pep talk and then later he made sure I stayed engaged with the class material by asking me about it periodically. Those two little things made all the difference; they helped me get over a bump on the road of my academic journey.</p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">We should not underestimate the power of our kind words or actions. In John’s case, small gestures from his wife made a huge difference in his life. Life can be difficult enough as it is, so it is important to treat others with kindness and compassion because we do not know about their inner struggles or worries at a glance. For John, Asperger’s syndrome makes it difficult to communicate and interact with others in a way that is deemed socially acceptable. For me, it was difficult to overcome a rough patch in my class without the support and encouragement from those around me. Our little acts of kindness can make somebody’s day, somebody’s semester, or somebody’s life better.</p>\n\n<hr size=\"15\">\n<p class=\"bodytext\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http://img.faculty.unlv.edu/lab/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Jelsy-Lab-Picture-2in-x-3.5in-DONE.jpg\" alt=\"Jelsy\" width=\"194\" height=\"281\" align=\"left\" hspace=\"5\" vspace=\"2\">Jelsy has been a member of the Interactive Measurement Group since Fall 2018.

It was an incredible, introspective, and humbling experience for me as I was thrust out of my comfort zone.</p>\n<p>How did I get here?  I first met Kim in Summer 2009 when I was enrolled in her introductory statistics course. I joined the Interactive Measurement Group soon after and was a member from Spring 2009 to Fall 2010. I gained valuable knowledge and hands-on experience that prepared me for a master’s program.  During my time in the lab I created two conference posters, ran workshops, supervised participants during  the Data Checking Study, scored that study data using SPSS, and trained other lab members to run the study and score the data. Kim encouraged me to take on challenging roles to build my academic and professional development. This gave me the courage to follow my dream of traveling and has now given me the courage to pursue my master’s degree.  I am still living abroad and will continue my studies in Scotland. With the help of Kim, I secured a place in the MSc Clinical Health Psychology program at University of Strathclyde. I’m incredibly grateful for the opportunity and look forward to my future.</p>\n<hr size=\"15\">\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n",

I recently finished my Masters in Communication Studies at UNLV, producing a master&#8217;s thesis as my culminating experience. My involvement in the Interactive Measurement Group provided significant preparation for graduate-level work and my thesis project. Through participating in workshops and projects as a lab member, I entered graduate school very familiar with designing surveys using Qualtrics and using SONA to recruit participants from the university student pool and grant them credit afterwards. Additionally, I was prepared to clean and analyze data, and communicate my findings using an academic writing style I developed during my undergraduate research experience. </p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">Here is a summary of my thesis research. </p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">Today&#8217;s emerging adults (ages 18-29) are customizing their relationships to fulfill specific desires, needs, and goals in manners perhaps considered to be nontraditional in days past (Barker, 2011; Barker &amp; Langdridge, 2010). Non-monogamy is an umbrella term that covers a variety of relationship configurations – including open, swinging, and polyamory – in which individuals have negotiated the allowance of emotional/sexual connections with multiple partners (Barker &amp; Langdridge, 2010; Cohen &amp; Wilson, 2017; Pitagora, 2016). The purpose of my master’s thesis was to explore the association among identity, relational labeling, and orientations toward uncommitted sex and non-monogamy to better understand why various relational labels were being used to distinguish between non-monogamous practices that have similar/overlapping definitions, behaviors, and rules. Specifically, is relational orientation influenced by (1) other aspects of the individual&#8217;s identity (personal, relational, social, collective), (2) their attitudes regarding non-monogamy, and (3) their general orientations regarding uncommitted sex (sociosexual attitudes, behaviors, desires). These research questions were built on self-identity research suggesting that social interactions and behaviors are influenced by how individuals define themselves in relation to others (Johnson, 2018), as well as findings indicating that emerging adults today are participating in and exposed to diverse sexual and relational practices.</p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">Data were collected online from 450 emerging adults (18-29; M<sub>age</sub> = 22), who were recruited from Reddit pages and from entry-level communication studies courses at a large diverse university in the southwest. I found that strong identification with social categories and groups (e.g., religion, heritage, citizenship, race/ethnic background; <i>F</i>(6, 437) = 8.31, <i>p</i> &lt; .0001) and social roles and reputation (e.g., reputation, attractiveness, physical appearance, popularity, <i>F</i>(6, 435) = 3.705, <i>p</i> &lt; .001) are related to the way that individuals identify their relational orientation as well as their orientations toward uncommitted sex and non-monogamy. Emerging adults who identify as strictly <i>monogamous</i>, <i>monogamish</i>, and <i>open</i> had significantly stronger connections to collective and social identity aspects compared to those who identify as <i>polyamorous</i>. It makes sense that polyamorous individuals would be less likely to define their sense of self in relation to social status or heritage/community, given that polyamorous individuals have traditionally been marginalized and excluded from social groups (e.g., Jordan, Grogan, Muruthi, &amp; Bermúdez, 2017). Thus, my findings suggest that polyamorous individuals are less influenced by social scaffolding and labeling or, perhaps, are simply rejecting it altogether (e.g., Averett, 2016).</p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">Non-monogamous individuals (i.e., monogamish, open, swinging, and polyamorous) have a more positive orientation toward uncommitted sex and non-monogamy than those who identify as strictly monogamous, supporting previous findings (Klesse, 2018; Mogilski, Memering, Welling, &amp; Shackelford, 2017). Individuals who identify as strictly monogamous have less positive views regarding non-monogamy and indicate fewer sociosexual desires, but some of these individuals do enact the same types of non-monogamous practices as those who label themselves as monogamish.</p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">One&#8217;s relational orientation (i.e., strictly monogamous, monogamish, swinging, open, negotiable, and polyamorous) is influenced by the preponderance of one’s social categories/group and social roles/reputation (e.g., religion, heritage, citizenship, race/ethnic background, reputation, attractiveness, physical appearance, popularity). Strictly monogamous, monogamish, and open individuals all have significantly higher associations with these identity facets than polyamorous individuals. However, monogamish and open individuals have similar sociosexual orientations as polyamorous folks, all of whom reported significantly more uncommitted sexual behaviors and desires than strictly monogamous individuals. These data indicate that the extensiveness of one’s associations to social categories/group and social roles/reputation are related to individuals’ decisions to choose a monogamish, open, or new relational orientation to represent their variation of non-monogamy, instead of labeling themselves as polyamorous, even when the behaviors and desires are the same or similar. Additionally, the preponderance of certain social categories, roles, and reputations in one&#8217;s identity influence how one chooses to label one’s relational orientation, attitudes toward non-monogamy, and orientation toward uncommitted sex. </p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">Several implications can be drawn from these findings as they relate to identity in the emerging adult population. Because individuals with a collective identity orientation view the social world through the lens of their group members and value the importance of their group membership in their self-concept (Cheek &amp; Briggs, 2013), it is possible that these individuals are responding to the identity items with consideration of their social values/heritages, which are traditionally conservative regarding sexuality and sexual practices (Cheek &amp; Briggs, 2013). Thus, the finding that individuals with strong collective identities hold negative attitudes toward non-monogamy and relational promiscuity makes sense, given that people with a strong connection to religion and family heritage/ tradition also typically value conservative sexual attitudes and norms (e.g., Ahrold, Farmer, Trapnell, &amp; Meston, 2011). These data support Gaertner et al.’s (2012) argument that identity aspects have “motivational potency due to their susceptibility to norms of interdependence, connectedness and the importance of others” (p. 999) and Seta, Seta, and Hundt’s (2001) findings that individuals’ identity orientations can shape their social perceptions. </p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">This study offers foundational insight into the association between identity and how individuals choose to label and represent their relational orientation, particular regarding non-monogamous practices.  This is the only study of its kind to consider the associations among identity and relational orientations, sociosexuality, and attitudes. These associations are of importance because, as indicated by the sample data, identity influences the way individuals label their relational orientations, as well as their orientations, behaviors, and attitudes regarding uncommitted sex and sexual engagement. In the current culture, which largely privileges monogamy and heteronormativity (Jordan et al., 2017), it is important to consider how individuals with marginalized identities (such as non-binary, non-heterosexual, and non-monogamous individuals) choose to label and represent themselves, as these individuals face negative stigmatization and backlash (Blumer &amp; VandenBosch, 2015).  The topic of non-monogamy is of particular concern, as it is evident that emerging adults today are more open to forms of non-monogamy without any formal/legal recognition or rights. Current research suggests that 54–67% of today&#8217;s emerging adults endorse and engage in non-monogamy and that 31% of women and 38% of men indicated that their ideal relationship would involve some variation of non-monogamy (Moore, 2016). With so many individuals openly participating in these various relational orientations, this topic has the potential to become the next moral/legal debate regarding marriage (Dugan, 2017; King &amp; Cronin, 2016) and family (Sheff, 2017), making continued research regarding this issue crucial. A better understanding of how certain role identities, such as one&#8217;s relational orientation, are influenced is essential, as we could presently be on the verge of a new frontier of sexual, emotional, and familial relationship practices and communications.</p>\n\n<p class=\"body\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http://img.faculty.unlv.edu/lab/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Relational-Orientations-second-content-photo-DONE.jpg\" alt=\"hands\" width=\"850\" height=\"535\" align=\"center\" hspace=\"5\" vspace=\"25\"></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">References</p>\n\n<div style=\"padding-left: 4em; text-indent: -4em;\">\n<p>Ahrold, T.

Once I joined the Interactive Measurement Group, I got used to reading journal articles for literature reviews and projects, and it started to get easier. But it wasn’t until I found Professor Ashley Rubin’s, &#8220;<a href=https://ashleytrubin.com/resources/\">Guide to Reading Non-Textbooks</a>”(just before starting graduate school at UC Irvine), that I started to not only understand, but enjoy what each author had to say within their publication. </p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">The first part of her reading guide outlined the “Background Elements” of the non-textbook (e.g., date of publication and the kind of text – scholarly journal article, book, newspaper) and the “Key Elements” to make note of (e.g., the research question, thesis, hypotheses, key findings, key terms, data and methodology, and limitations). Rubin then explained that it is up to you to identify the important parts of the text. Not all sections and details hold equal value. For example, you might reference one article for a specific type of data analysis and another for one of its findings. This was a revelation to me, learning that I should use an article for how it was of value to me, not based upon how it was of value to the original authors.</p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">The section, “What if you are completely lost?” held another major insight: Rubin explained it is okay if you do not understand 100% of the article the first time you read it. This comforted me because I have had trouble understanding everything in an article the first time, which was frustrating to me, especially when I had several articles to read. Reading Rubin’s guide reassured me that the lack of knowledge was only temporary. To understand both the big picture and the specifics, she says you might have to read the article more than once. You should do this by noting the specific concepts that you are grasping in addition to the concepts that you are not grasping the first time. This way, you will know what concepts to go back to for a second or even third time. </p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">These are two of Rubin’s lessons (among several others).  Rubin’s guide helped me enjoy each reading, while appreciating and respecting the researchers who are conveying their knowledge to the psychology community. We are reading someone’s sweat and tears that took months and even years to develop and perfect. Research is long and complex, and journal articles reflect that. Therefore, it makes complete sense to read the article more than once. Rubin’s guide has put my view of reading articles in a more optimistic light than ever before. I recommend you read <a href=https://ashleytrubin.com/resources/\">Rubin’s guide</a> in full, to learn how you can make your own reading easier and more enjoyable.</p>\n\n<hr size=\"15\">\n<p class=\"bodytext\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http://img.faculty.unlv.edu/lab/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Asia-Professional-Picture-DONE.jpg\" alt=\"Asia\" width=\"182\" height=\"185\" align=\"left\" hspace=\"5\" vspace=\"5\">Asia Chapa has been a member of the Interactive Measurement Group since Spring 2017 and served as Lab Manager from Fall 2017 to Spring 2018.

Putting on my socks.  Brushing my teeth.  Making tea.  I know the steps involved and I can do them without thinking.  Often, we want to make a new behavior a routine, but doing it just once is hard enough as it is.  Exercising daily.  Avoiding sweets.  Spending more time with family and friends.  Such routine habits are the substance of most New Year’s resolutions.  We wish we had better habits than we do, but we aren’t sure how to make that happen. </p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">If you want to develop a new habit, I strongly recommend you complete a 30-day challenge.  Commit yourself to doing this behavior for 30 days.  Tell your friends and family you are going to do it.  Post your successes and failures where everyone can see them (e.g., Facebook or the refrigerator door).  At the end of 30 days, tell everyone how you did.</p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">I recommend you start with something simple.  My first 30-day challenge was to pet our cat Loki every day.  Before I started, I established the ground rules with my husband.  I had to pet him for a full minute.  In addition, I had to seek out the cat: it didn’t count if the cat came up to me to be petted.</p> \n\n<p class=\"body\">Even though patting the cat seemed easy – I was already capable of doing this any time I wanted – doing this for 30 days in a row  was harder than I thought it would be.  For the first few days, I tracked down the cat wherever he was sleeping and petted him for a minute.  After about a week, though, Loki sought me out.  When I came home from UNLV, he came to greet me.  I certainly petted him, but that didn’t count for the 30-day challenge.  I had to seek him out later on, when he wasn’t with me.  By the end of the month, this 30-day challenge transformed our relationship.  Before the challenge, Loki and I mostly ignored each other.  After the challenge, we had an affectionate relationship.  I strongly recommend this type of challenge for anyone who wants to improve their relationship with their cat!</p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">But 30-day challenges are useful for much more than just improving your relationship with a pet.  It takes roughly 30 days to build a habit.  Therefore, you can use a 30-day challenge to build any habit you want to do on a daily basis.  I have used 30-day challenges to increase my exercise, improve my sleep, and improve my diet.  I recommend you start with a very simple challenge (flossing at night, hugging your family, or putting your shoes in the closet when you get home).  Build your way up to more difficult challenges over time.</p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">Ideas for 30-day challenges abound.  Here’s one list:</p>\n\n<p class=\"body\"><a href=\"http://thoughtbrick.com/lifestyle/hundred-30-day-challenge-ideas/\">http://thoughtbrick.com/lifestyle/hundred-30-day-challenge-ideas/</a></p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">Pick something that looks both interesting and fun.  Soon you’ll find you’ve learned the essential skills needed for a 30-day challenge: keeping track of progress, motivating yourself to get started, and pushing through the tough days.  As you complete one challenge after another, think how these challenges can help you transform bad habits into good routines and bring you closer to your ideal life.  You can do it, one day at a time, 30 days at a time.</p>\n<hr size=\"15\">\n<p class=\"bodytext\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http://img.faculty.unlv.edu/lab/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Barchard-2014-crop-DONE.jpg\" alt=\"Kim\" width=\"180\" height=\"186\" align=\"left\" hspace=\"5\" vspace=\"0\">Kimberly A.

Without setting a goal, how does an individual track their success? In secondary school I remember being taught that for a goal to be effective, it should be SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Timely). I thought I knew everything I needed to know about setting goals, but it wasn’t until I read The Jackrabbit Factor: Why You Can by Leslie Householder that I discovered exactly what was missing from my own goal setting. </p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">For a goal to be SMART, it must be specific. One strategy for creating specific goals is to answer questions related to your goal. One of my goals is to graduate from college; however, this goal (as currently written) is broad and nonspecific. It answers the “who” question (I) and the “what” question (graduate), but it neglects the “where,” “which,” and “why” questions. For example, I should specify that I will graduate from UNLV, the degree I will graduate with is a B.A. in Psychology, and I want to graduate to get into graduate school. In addition to being specific, SMART goals must be measurable. I must answer the “how” question to determine how I know a goal is complete. For my graduation goal, this is easy: I can measure completion when I receive my diploma at UNLV’s commencement. SMART goals must also be achievable. Therefore, my goal must be actually possible. Graduating from UNLV with my B.A. in Psychology is highly realistic. I only have two semesters to go. As long as I continue to do well in my classes and put in the effort, I will graduate from UNLV. In addition, SMART goals must be relevant. I must answer whether this goal is worth the required effort. In my case, graduating from UNLV is a stepping stone to a much loftier aspiration; I want to teach at a community college or university. Before doing do that, I need to earn a PhD. Graduating helps me to work towards this future because admittance to graduate school requires a bachelor’s degree. Therefore, graduating is absolutely worth the effort. Finally, for a goal to be SMART, it must also be timely. I need to answer the “when” question. When will I graduate? Easy, spring 2020. By using the SMART approach to goal setting, my new smarter goal statement would be: I will graduate with my B.A. in Psychology during UNLV’s spring 2020 commencement, in order to prepare myself for graduate school and teaching at a community college or university. </p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">However, after reading The Jackrabbit Factor, I discovered that one problem with setting a goal like this is that it is written in the future tense. But that makes sense! I haven’t completed my goal yet, so obviously it has to be in the future tense. Or does it? Householder argues that by writing a goal statement in the future tense, you are effectively keeping it there permanently. And because this goal resides perpetually in the future, it becomes lost forever in the throes of “maybe someday”. Therefore, Householder instead urges us to write our goal statements in the past tense, as though the goal were already achieved.  Specifically, she recommends we write a diary entry, complete with a future date at the top, talking about how wonderful it is to have achieved our goal. Householder’s future diary entries have many of the same elements as SMART goals. The entry should be specific, it should explain the importance of achieving the goal and more importantly how achieving that goal made you feel, and it is naturally timely because it is based on a real future target date. Using my graduation as an example I have written my future diary entry below.</p>\n\n<p class=\"body\"><i>May 19, 2020.</i></p>\n<p class=\"body\"><i>I had a wonderful time today at UNLV’s commencement ceremony where I walked across the stage and received my bachelor’s degree in Psychology. It was a little nerve-wracking walking across the stage and so I’m glad I didn’t trip or stumble and embarrass myself. There were so many people there! All my family attended, despite my protests and multiple attempts to dissuade them from doing so. Kim was there, wearing her infamous red hat, and I couldn’t help but smile when I saw her. Of course, I remembered to wear my lab cords, even though the purple clashed with the red graduation gowns. I felt pangs of nostalgia thinking about the Interactive Measurement Group and all the friends I had made there. I am a little sad to be leaving soon, but am looking forward to beginning graduate school in the fall. I’m looking forward to being a teaching assistant, too, since this will help prepare me for my own classes. After the ceremony today I met up with my family. We did the awkward-hugging thing and the taking-endless-pictures thing. After what felt like an eternity of picture taking, we went to have a celebratory dinner at Applebee’s Grill + Bar. I’m overjoyed to have graduated from UNLV, but tomorrow I need to write a new future diary entry for what I will have accomplished in graduate school.</i></p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">Householder’s diary entries blew my mind. Instead of thinking about how I can someday achieve a goal, I needed to think about how I will have achieved that goal. And this is just one of the many lessons on finding success that I appreciated from The Jackrabbit Factor. I encourage you to read this book. Householder even offers a free copy of the e-book on her <a href=\"https://jackrabbitfactor.com/\">website</a>.</p> \n\n<hr size=\"15\">\n<p class=\"bodytext\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http://img.faculty.unlv.edu/lab/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Matt-Author-Photo-DONE.jpg\" alt=\"Matt\" width=\"180\" height=\"185\" align=\"left\" hspace=\"5\" vspace=\"0\">\n\nMatt Helm has been in the Interactive Measurement Group since Spring 2018.
