OUR proudly presented the 2021 Outstanding Faculty Mentor Award to Dr. Barchard for her record of excellence in inspiring, influencing, supporting, and mentoring undergraduate researchers in their professional development, career training, and educational journey.</span></p>\n<hr><!-- –– ######################### ––--><p></p>\n<p style=\"line-height: 1.6;\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\"><b>Describe your current role and research interests.&nbsp;</b><br>I am a Professor in the Department of Psychology. &nbsp;Over the years, I have studied a wide variety of topics, from theoretical statistics to practical decision-making. &nbsp;Recently, I have turned my research to the climate crisis.</span></p>\n<p><!-- –– ######################### ––--></p>\n<p style=\"line-height: 1.6;\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\">Most people in the US are concerned about climate change. &nbsp;But some people view climate change as affecting other people in far off locations rather than having immediate local impacts, and some people recognize climate change is affecting the places they love, right now, but do not know what they can do about this global problem. &nbsp;Therefore, I have started research to determine how we can help people recognize the immediate local impacts of climate change to create a sense of immediacy and urgency, how we can increase people’s sense of self-efficacy so they act on their beliefs, and how we can encourage people to act sustainably by harnessing the power of social norms.</span></p>\n<p style=\"line-height: 1.6;\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\"><b>What inspired you to start conducting research and what motivates you to pursue research in your field?</b><br>Enthusiasm about research is contagious. &nbsp;One day during my Personality Psychology course, the instructor gave a lecture about his own research. &nbsp;He was so animated and enthusiastic that I went to his office hours to ask how I could get involved. &nbsp;This led me to complete an honors thesis, go to graduate school, and pursue a research career.</span></p>\n<p style=\"line-height: 1.6;\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\">Throughout my career, I have followed my interests, reading about topics that intrigue me and then designing new research on unanswered questions. &nbsp;I like learning new things and figuring out how they fit together – fiddling with the phrasing and formatting of questionnaires, writing complex programs to analyze my data, and drawing graphs to discern how variables affect each other. &nbsp;I am grateful I received course credit to do research when I was a student, which now allows me to be paid to do what I love: conduct research and teach others how to do so.</span></p>\n<p style=\"line-height: 1.6;\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\"><b>How do you define undergraduate research and why do you recommend getting involved in research?</b><br>Many undergraduates design and conduct experiments as part of a research methods course. &nbsp;Research experience builds upon that foundation by providing individual mentoring on a longer project. &nbsp;Students can work with faculty and graduate students by volunteering in a research lab, registering for independent study or independent research, or participating in the Center for Academic Enrichment and Outreach spring semester research experience or summer research institute.</span></p>\n<p style=\"line-height: 1.6;\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\">Research experience is the best way for students to earn strong letters of recommendation for graduate school, law school, and medical school. &nbsp;Even if students are not planning to go to a post-baccalaureate program, research experience will challenge students in ways that are not available in the typical undergraduate classroom, allowing them to develop their problem-solving, communication, and team-work skills – skills that are in high demand in the workplace. &nbsp;Therefore, I recommend individually mentored research experience to any undergraduate who wants to get more out of their undergraduate years.</span></p>\n<p style=\"line-height: 1.6;\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\"><b>What advice would you give to undergraduates looking to become involved in research?</b><br><em><b>Start early</b></em><br>Many graduate programs want students to have at least a year of research experience when they apply. &nbsp;Even if students are not applying to a post-baccalaureate program, once they have started doing research, they usually want to do more. &nbsp;Thus, it’s good to start in your junior year. &nbsp;That said, it’s never too late to start. &nbsp;Students sometimes join a research lab just before graduation (or even after graduation), when they realize they need research experience to pursue their academic plans. &nbsp;Therefore, if you wish you had gotten started earlier, don’t despair: Just get started now.</span></p>\n<p style=\"line-height: 1.6;\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\"><em><b>Do lots</b></em><br>The more you put into your research, the more you will get out of it. I recommend students spend at least 10 hours per week. &nbsp;If you don’t have that much time right now, start smaller. &nbsp;If you decide you want more experience, figure out how to fit it into your schedule next semester. &nbsp;For example, maybe you can register for an independent study course that will count towards your degree or maybe you can join one of the UNLV programs that provide student stipends.</span></p>\n<p style=\"line-height: 1.6;\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\"><em><b>Follow your interests</b></em><br>Talk to the instructor or teaching assistant in your favorite course to learn how you can get involved in that kind of research. &nbsp;Alternatively, use the department website to learn about ongoing projects at UNLV.</span></p>\n<p style=\"line-height: 1.6;\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\"><b>What is the process for students interested in conducting research under your mentorship?</b><br>Students who are interested in joining our lab typically email me to introduce themselves. &nbsp;After we have talked by email, they meet with a couple of our current lab members to learn more about our research. Usually they start their research experience at the beginning of the next semester in a cohort of 2 to 8 new lab members. &nbsp;We do not set any maximum number of research assistants: We welcome everyone who is a good fit for our lab.</span></p>\n<p style=\"line-height: 1.6;\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\">New lab members learn essential research skills, such as how to design online studies and how to analyze data using SPSS and R. &nbsp;They also start planning what they’ll do after graduation by designing their curriculum vitae, drafting a statement of purpose, and looking into post-baccalaureate programs. &nbsp;After their first semester, lab members analyze data to create professional conference posters, learn advanced statistical techniques, and run workshops. &nbsp;Advanced lab members create new psychological measures and design and run new studies. &nbsp;Many lab members stay in my lab for six semesters or more, but they never run out of new things they can learn.</span></p>\n<p style=\"line-height: 1.6;\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\"><b>How has the Office of Undergraduate Research (OUR) supported your research endeavors?</b><br>Sharing your findings with others is an essential step in the research process. &nbsp;However, presenting at out-of-town conferences is time-consuming and expensive. &nbsp;Fortunately, OUR helps students communicate their findings to the academic community. &nbsp;Eleven of our lab members have presented their work at the OUR Undergraduate Research Symposia in the last two years, and two are currently preparing a manuscript to submit to the Spectra Undergraduate Research Journal.</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:100px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n",

Her mentor explained that she would need to get research experience and that she would need to perform well on the Graduate Record Exam, so she set out to work on these two goals. First, she joined the Interactive Measurement Group. Over the last five semesters, she has completed over 1,200 lab hours, during which she completed three posters (two of which have already been presented at professional conferences), served as the managing editor for the lab’s newsletter and, most recently, helped design a new research study. In Spring 2022, she also joined the Psychophysiology of Emotion and Personality lab, where she has learned how to run participants through electroencephalogram (EEG) and behavioral studies. Throughout this period, Cassandra has also been studying for the GRE and has significantly improved her practice test scores. This will serve her well when she takes the GRE this summer. Cassandra’s continued progress toward her OUMP goals has not only helped her prepare for graduate school, but it has also recently earned her the OUMP Shining Star Award.</p>\n<p>Congratulations, Cassandra!</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<hr size=\"15\" />\n",

Previous research has shown that mindfulness reduces job burnout. His thesis explored the hypothesis that positive reappraisal mediates that relationship. Using a sample of 325 MTurk workers, Fitsum showed that, for all five facets of mindfulness, positive reappraisal partially or fully mediates the mindfulness-burnout relationship. This suggests that people who are experiencing job burnout can use whichever mindfulness skills are most appealing to them: All of them have the potential to be helpful. Fitsum presented his honors research at the Spring 2022 Research Symposium sponsored by the Office of Undergraduate Research, where he received the Research and Creative Honors Thesis Presentation award for giving the best honors thesis presentation. Congratulations, Fitsum!</p>\n<p class=\"body\">\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<hr size=\"15\" />\n",

I made it through my first couple semesters with little difficulty and good grades to boot. But in my third semester, something shook my world. This is when I joined UNLV’s Outreach Undergraduate Mentoring Program (OUMP) and quickly learned that good grades weren’t going to get me into graduate school – I needed research experience. Moreover, since I had such a busy schedule, I needed to get a head start on studying for the GRE and investigating possible graduate schools. The thought of adding anything else to my plate was quite overwhelming, but I took the advice of my OUMP mentor and began using a calendar to manage my time. Now that I’m in my final semester, looking back at all that I’ve accomplished, I know that none of it would have been possible had I not made her – my calendar – my best friend. </p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">Our friendship has taught me two important lessons. The first of which is this: Schedule EVERYTHING! When I first started out, I scheduled the obvious. I apprised my calendar of exam dates and assignment due dates, and I worked with her to schedule blocks of study/reading time. After joining the Interactive Measurement Group, I kept her up to date on lab meetings, poster assignments, and other lab homework. Initially, it seemed to be working well, but I soon noticed that the things I omitted weren’t getting done. For example, I wasn’t scheduling time to study for the GRE or research graduate schools. Concerned I wasn’t doing all that is necessary to get into graduate school, I consulted my calendar. She helped me find available blocks of time where I could squeeze these things in, and I started to make visible progress on these additional goals. With her help, I have now significantly improved my GRE practice test scores and compiled a list of schools to apply to. I suppose it’s a lot like any relationship – communication is key. If I don’t communicate all of my goals to my calendar, she can’t help me accomplish them.</p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">The second lesson our friendship has taught me is that I must estimate how long each task will take. Moreover, I must reexamine my estimate if I find a task is taking longer than anticipated. For example, when I first began taking 300-level courses, I timed how long it took to read a typical chapter and then consulted my calendar so we could set aside reading time each week. This worked wonderfully – until I started taking 400-level courses. Halfway through a reading assignment, I heard my calendar yelling at me – reminding me it was time for our next task. Determined to finish my reading assignment before moving on, I ignored her and then had to rearrange the next several days to fit in the tasks that hadn’t gotten done. After a couple of these instances, and some nagging from my calendar, I agreed to reexamine the time allotted for these readings. Together, we looked at how long my most recent readings had taken, and we updated my schedule accordingly. Again, communicating with my calendar helped me succeed – and with a lot less stress. </p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">When my calendar and I first met, I believed she would be a great help to me. But I didn’t know just how much. Over time, I realized that maintaining a strong relationship with her was and always will be essential to my success. I highly recommend not just using a calendar, but truly making friends with it – relying on it to support you in ALL of your goals. Schedule EVERYTHING. Estimate how long it will take to complete each task and reexamine your estimates when they aren’t working for you. Doing this will help prevent backing yourself into a corner with too much on your plate and not enough time. By making my calendar my best friend, I was able to successfully maintain a full-time job, take classes, and participate in a research lab – all while preparing for graduate school and remaining on track to graduate summa cum laude. I encourage you to do the same and find out firsthand the success your calendar can help you achieve.  </p>\n\n\n<hr size=\"15\">\n<p class=\"bodytext\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http://img.faculty.unlv.edu/lab/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Author-Photo-2-Cassandra-September-20-2021-DONE-1.jpg\" alt=\"jd\" width=\"181\" height=\"195\" align=\"left\" hspace=\"5\" vspace=\"1\">Cassandra Hoffman has been a member of the Interactive Measurement Group since the fall of 2020. During her time in the lab, she has served as a poster team leader and managing editor for the lab’s newsletter, and she has conducted a variety of workshops to help new and existing lab members. She is graduating this semester with a B.A. in psychology and a minor in neuroscience. After graduation, she plans to pursue a Ph.D. in clinical psychology, hopefully doing research on moral injury and/or trauma-related disorders.</p>\n<br>\n<p class=\"bodytext\">&nbsp;</p>\n<hr size=\"15\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n",

But as the saying goes––there ain’t no such thing as a free lunch. Future Me paid for my procrastination by working overloaded: She felt stressed by all the deadlines and had to give up things she enjoyed. I paid for my procrastination because she threw negative emotions back at me: I felt anxious and ashamed. Moreover, I sometimes chose to deal with these negative feelings by immersing myself in instant gratification, ending up with more procrastination. I thought I would never be friends with Future Me because I was mean to her. Procrastination was always a barrier in our relationship. </p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">The two-minute rule helped cure my procrastination. In his book, Atomic Habits, James Clear says to do the task you need to do for two minutes, and if you still hate doing it after two minutes, stop. Before trying the two-minute rule, I thought it might make my procrastination worse, giving me an excuse to stop after just two minutes. However, it really worked for me! One day, my homework was to summarize several research papers. I didn’t feel like doing it because I thought it would be hard, so I naturally wanted to let Future Me take over that task because she would “have more time to work on it.” But then I remembered the two-minute rule and decided to try it. During those first two minutes, I found I actually enjoyed the topic and would like to spend more time on it. It turned out that I studied for two solid hours and got the assignment finished. My procrastination was cured! </p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">Now, whenever I feel like procrastinating, I force myself to try things for two minutes. Once I start working, I usually find the tasks to be easier and more enjoyable than I imagined. This has really motivated me to keep using the two-minute rule. Now I finish most tasks way ahead of the deadlines, allowing Future Me to do the things she wants. I also feel more powerful because I live a productive life and have fewer negative emotions. Not only did the two-minute rule cure my procrastination, it also helped me build a healthier relationship with Future Me. </p>\n\n<hr size=\"15\">\n<p class=\"bodytext\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http://img.faculty.unlv.edu/lab/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/unnamed-e1650491782887.jpg\" alt=\"jd\" width=\"175\" height=\"194\" align=\"left\" hspace=\"5\" vspace=\"1\">Yuhan Bi has been a member of the Interactive Measurement Group since the summer of 2021.

When writing this novel, Maxwell drew on his memories of losing his own mother during that pandemic. During our more recent pandemic, I read They Came Like Swallows as part of my thesis, reading and re-reading sections, placing post-it notes near important passages, and scribbling notes in the margins. Beyond my academic interests, I found camaraderie with Maxwell and Bunny; the focus on everyday, yet deeply personal and meaningful, moments struck a chord with me. Maxwell taught me to appreciate and find solace in mundane moments.</p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">I gained this insight from the nostalgic, albeit melancholic, scenes where Maxwell recollects the small, ordinary moments from his life before his mother’s death. For example, at one point, Bunny sits with his mother at a window seat in their Lincoln, Illinois home. Nothing particularly noteworthy takes place, but Bunny still narrates the small details – patterns on the rug, slight noises in the house, and locations of items and furniture. Readers leave this moment with a feeling of comfort and solace because Bunny feels at peace and safe in his house. As I analyzed Maxwell’s use of his art to communicate and relive the most comfortable and wholesome times of his life, I looked at the ordinary items around my own home in a new light: the cobalt blue couch I insisted on purchasing, the plants near the windows, the bookcase that takes up a whole wall, pictures of my and my partner’s families. I appreciated my quiet home filled with items connected to my happiness and peace. I realized that these ordinary pieces of furniture, familiar books, and pictures from my favorite memories bring joy to even the most mundane days.</p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">Despite finding happiness and peace inside my home, the glaring absence of my family felt heavy. Due to the pandemic and living in a different state for graduate school, I had not seen my family for almost two years. Maxwell’s narration reminded me of what I wanted most: time with my family. Just like Maxwell, I reflected on the small moments with my loved ones before the pandemic, and I longed for the minute details that always subconsciously comforted me. For instance, Maxwell’s window seat scene reminded me of spending Friday evenings with my family: After a stressful day, we shared work stories while eating takeout and listening to the local news. Maxwell’s text reminded me to appreciate those memories; while they may have been small, they were far from insignificant. Mundane experiences often carry the most comfort and solace due to their familiarity. </p>\n\n<p class=\"body\">With newfound respect and appreciation for ordinary occasions, I met with my family via Skype and Zoom more often, and we reintegrated our Friday-evening-hangouts into our schedules. Just like Maxwell and his mother, along with the fictional Bunny and his mother, my family and I rejoiced in the small victory of spending time with one another. I learned not to take ordinary experiences for granted – a valuable lesson during an arguably terrible time in history. Almost an entire year later, in 2021, I safely traveled back to Las Vegas to see my family in person. Just as we did before the pandemic and my move, we fell into a comfortable pattern of conversations in the cozy living room, exchanging work stories, and discussing nothing and everything. </p>\n\n\n<hr size=\"15\">\n<p class=\"bodytext\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http://img.faculty.unlv.edu/lab/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Barraza-Photo-DONE-e1650493367212.jpg\" alt=\"jd\" width=\"156\" height=\"195\" align=\"left\" hspace=\"5\" vspace=\"1\">Kristy Barraza was a member of the Interactive Measurement Group from Spring 2016 to Fall 2017.

Over the past five semesters, he has taken on a wide variety of challenging leadership and research roles.  As poster supervisor for the last year, Orei designed and taught lessons on confirmatory factor analysis and mentored eight teams as they created conference posters. Orei also helped design our first study on climate change, which included the creation of a new measure: the 77-item Climate Change Action Inventory.  In addition, Orei has chaired lab meetings, mentored junior lab members formally and informally, and given feedback on a variety of posters, presentations, papers, and even computer programs.  Orei graduated from UNLV with a B.A. in Psychology in December 2021. In Fall 2022, he will begin pursuing a Master’s degree in Clinical Mental Health Counseling at UNLV.  Congratulations, Orei!</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<hr size=\"15\">\n",
